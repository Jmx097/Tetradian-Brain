for this episode Brusco asked about the usefulness of capability maps how capability mapping works how it connects with things like business process mapping and relating business strategy to IT strategy well where I started from this this is actually where I personally started in enterprise architecture was on what we could there we called functional business model which effectively was a kind of capability map that described what the organization did as a whole and from there we then derived what business information was each of those areas doing and from there we derived information systems which in turn drove guided us on our IT strategy so let's have a how-to on this a practical how-to if we think of a typical business we can partition businesses every business every organization essentially into five different parts which are stuff coming in stuff we do stuff that goes out stuff support services that generally support everything going on and what we might call management functions things that deal with change they'll deal with coordination change guidance that kind of area so every business is exactly the same in that sense if we think break those into each of those boxes into five to ten bits we'll end up with 50 boxes that describe what goes on typically in our kind of industry so that's the next tier down the level of detail with added a bit of detail to this five part box so now got about 50 boxes that describe the general functions the general capabilities needed to make this kind of business work now we add another level of detail again and let have a look at the specific bits that we do in each of these 50 boxes we take those into a round five or so each we want to end up with something that will fit on a single sheet of paper that's that's typically at about a three your large size and but will still be readable in smaller size on a standard a4 or u.s. letter sheet we've now got a list of all of the different basic functions that are going on now there you have a lot of politics on this because everyone wants all of their functions to be listed but across the whole of the space you want to summarize it to a total of about 250 boxes those describe all the different bits like we were saying sort for mail in the postal environment well then say well what are the major functions or major capabilities that are needed to sort the mail will we need the machines we need the human sort we need the IT boxes coming in we need to have things to deal with it going in things to deal with they're coming out then from that your 250 boxes we can then say well which bits in all of these boxes are people doing the same thing or working on the same kinds of information now in that particular company we broke that down to about 20 different chunks that connect it across all of the different space and we color-coded them as you can see here now from that what we called the business systems model the models that were the areas that we're dealing with the same kind of stuff we then said well one of the information systems that cover each of those spaces we wanted for each of those spaces those chunks ideally we wanted to have a single core source of truth for each of those chunks so us 20 business systems chunks with effort wanted to have about 20 major information systems that will be the master of the master record lots of its hanging off it but the master record for each of those chunks so that gives us a way of describing what's going on in the business who's doing what and how they connect across the whole business which means you've got business processes that cross between business silos and also how you're dealing with the information and information flows and the master information needed which gives you your IT strategy so a capability map or a functional business model gives you all of this in a way that's really easy to see to understand and to use for real practical purposes
