continuing on with this introduction to change mapping our idea or our aim is to capture ideas insights and information that we can use we want to be able to keep track of where we are hints change mapping building a map of every part of the change now within this each of those domains that we talked about context scope plan action review we're actually collecting and using different types of information that each of those stages that's why in s effort they've got different perspectives on how the whole thing works so in the context what we're looking for all the time is big picture we're looking for vision that holds everything together actually use vision in action when we are completely lost we know what's going on but said to help us keep stable in the midst of deep uncertainty so context helps us collect that information it helps us find values that we're going to use to guide our scope but it's going to find standards laws and so on similar industry standards that were due to use in planning we're going to pick those up because whatever solution you are going to build whatever we're going to work on will need of those standards we'll need those visions so when even if we trim it right down to the smallest one even down to the smallest level we still need access to the information that we got in context now within context we're going to so that's giving us a work in context but always looking upward to the big picture when we get to scope we're partitioning off a small bit of that big picture to work on we're going to do a project on some part but it's always connected back to the context that we started with here we're going to look at things like boundaries we're going to look at things like skills looking at stakeholders we need to identify who does what what the reason is we often describe this as a people area it's because those choices are always made by people whereas the big picture to a large extent is itself we are choosing which bits were going to work on we're choosing the chunk that we're going to act on so it's that's that we've set the and the whole idea is to make sure that we don't wander too far from that scope we know what we're going to do in the plan the next stage down we're going to build instructions we're going to look at the setup we're going to look at the start and end conditions that's the information we want to do we need to do with identify and resolve as many uncertainties as we can before we get into the action colleague described this is kind of bubble metaphor we have to shrink of the bubble in order to get through the skill level determines how big that space is going to be the more skill someone has the more uncertainty they're going to be able to do but a raw trainee or a computer system is not going to be able to deal with much uncertainty at all we've got to resolve any uncertainty during that plan fear period which we will often do by looping through iteratively to resolve as many into the action we also got the start and end conditions one of the common traps is that people know when to start but they don't know when to end particular if there's no obvious end point so any to identify what the signals are that tell us when to start when to end that's what we work on in the plan now in the action we're going to do the actions that are specified in the plan working it but we're also going to have to do sure of information arising because without that information we have nothing to learn from nothing to build nothing to review nothing to reassess that information is absolutely crucial and we need to set up how that information capture is going to be done and what we're going to capture in the plan phase linked back to the scope linked back to the context once the action is over we need to do a review we need to assess whether the benefits realized again benefits realized are going to be a the benefits to realize they're going to be identified in the context the scope and the plan but the benefits realized in the action we're going to need to add to check back against all of those phrases to make sure that we didn't actually do what we claim to do what we intended to do that if there's a variance which is where the lessons third comes in if there's a variance then look at the variance look at what worked well as well as what didn't work well look for all of that information about what we need to change and the distinction here between not just someone needs to change but what will I do personally what will we do as a team personally differently next time what will we commit to learning to do differently next time once so that we're ready for the next time around so that's the information that we're capturing in context scope plan action review regardless of scope scale content or context it's all the ways the same the core principle is always the same in change mapping thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links
