in the previous video I talked about architectures for uncertainty architectures for chaos and right now I'm living that in a very first hand way right now I'm in an airport at Heathrow Airport hotels Heathrow in London on my way to Australia and principle to a conference but unfortunately the earlier this morning there's a man now a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine required which means I can't go to the conference so I'm having to look very much firsthand at my own choices in my own situation and things that I can do to design around the chaos but one of them is that I can do this kind of video I don't need to see anyone or talk to anyone like it to get this video done I can just simply talk to a camera and publish the video without needing to touch or contact anyone else at all so these new technologies do definitely help for communication another one is that none of my plans are going to work out I'd planned to be in a hotel for three days travel around in a car see a few friends and then get a campervan for a for four weeks well all of those plans have been shot to ribbons I've now got to find somewhere to stay away from other people for 14 days and there's nowhere in the system in fact nowhere in the instructions as to how to do that I'm supposed perhaps to go to a hotel and lock myself out but I can only get a hotel for three days so there's a lot of design issues around here around how do we deal with when the situation requires us to do things that we actually can't do as that goes through a lot of our of architectures systems are very often very poorly designed and expect the people to sort out them at the structural errors and the structural problems in the arbitrarily designed piece of software or in this case an arbitrarily urgently placed policy with no means of actually following it through there's always something that slips through the cracks so these are really four points that we can think about within our architectures there are very useful wake-up call the other practical point is that I'll post this video today or tomorrow but I may well be out of action and offline for up to two to three maybe three weeks and if I do get ill since I'm a high risk category maybe for much longer so in a sense this may be a last video that you see I hope not but I hope the tools that we've developed over the years over the past couple of years and the videos that we've done that they're actually useful to you in the future thank you very much for all your interest in the work that I've been doing over these years thank you and see you later [Music]
