# Analysis: Enterprise architecture and coronavirus: Rights: Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video critiques the traditional concept of individual "rights" as absolute declarations that hinder collective survival during the coronavirus pandemic, arguing they lack mechanisms for implementation. It advocates reframing rights through mutual, interlocking responsibilities within social and organizational contexts. For enterprise architects, this shift is essential to rethink issues like property rights and control as organizations recover globally post-crisis.

## Key Takeaways
- Rights are flawed as mere declarations of desired outcomes without specifying how to achieve them, leading to conflicts when multiple parties claim the same right simultaneously.
- In a pandemic, personal freedoms and "rights" are laughable against the virus's indiscriminate threat, emphasizing survival through collective responsibility over individual privilege.
- Hierarchies often embed rights as privileges for superiors over subordinates, but should be reframed as mutual, interlocking responsibilities where managers act as support functions.
- Examples like Finland's right to high-speed broadband illustrate that rights only function via defined responsibilities and interlocks for fairness in society.
- Enterprise architects should test shifting from rights-based to responsibility-based approaches now, addressing property, possession, and control rights for post-coronavirus global reorganization.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- When encountering "rights" claims (e.g., property rights, control rights in organizations), systematically map them to underlying responsibilities: identify who holds each responsibility and the mutual interlocks that enable the outcome.
- Reframe organizational hierarchies: view managers as sideways support functions rather than superiors with overriding rights, fostering interlocking responsibilities across teams.
- In enterprise architecture practice, audit current rights-based structures (e.g., in business hierarchies or legal frameworks) and prototype responsibility-based alternatives to prepare for global-scale rethinking post-pandemic.

## Quotes
- "A right is really a declaration of a design outcome without any indication but how the heck going to get to that outcome it's often to absolute."
- "Survival depends on everyone's responsibility not arbitrary rights."
- "I have rights you have responsibilities this becomes rather questionable particularly when rights are those kind of rights are embedded in a social structure where someone is arbitrarily given privilege."
- "The so-called manager is actually a support function sideways on not above."
- "Whenever we look at rights we need to be looking at that what are the responsibilities and what are the mutuality what are the interlocks that make it work."[1][7]
