hi i'm tom graves just like to show you a sample of the kind of material that we will be looking at in the enterprise architecture masterclass series this example is about reframing or rethinking about how we look at architecture as a whole the classic view is to talk about people process and technology but another way of looking at this is to think of it in terms of actor scene and stage the advantage of doing this is it helps us to see the relationships between the different players in the space to find out more about the scene and how it works and also look at more about what's happening in the stage such as in this case the film camera and the cigarettes every part every process is a story or collection of stories every travis through is a kind of self-contained story each with its own actors its only actions its own events that start and end so when we look at an image like this the usual idea is that the actors are the people in front of the camera but actually it's everyone everyone in this space is an actor in the overall story one of the problems we have with it is it tends to look at actors as or its users as kind of robots rather than as real people and equally one other problem we have is that people tend to view machines as if there are other people for example the washing machines playing up it knew i was in a hurry today when we look at the relationship between structure and story so we look at process that's typically the view inside out from the organization looking out into the broader shared enterprise what we think i was when we look at things from the enterprise view the shared enterprise the supply chain and more it's more like an unfolding of story like a plot or a plot line so when we look at types of story some of them are scripted such as in a call center some of them are analyzed some of them are adapted from best practice needing skill and we very much need skill when we make things up on the fly as we go along when we look at a stage play it's made up of scenes in a story each with a beginning a middle and an end things happen things change same is true of a process model with a start event things happen there are end events there are identifiable scenes with a beginning a middle and an end a useful phrase that we collect from script writing is the idea of show don't tell each line of action drives the story forward in this case it's an emergency center police emergency center in switzerland they're looking for a missing boy now notice all of the props that underpin the story the little things that are often not noticed in this case the chair the glass and the ladder we can see here two of those actually directly used other props are used to set the scene to provide the context when we look at the story of the emergency center much the same applies there are the computers and all the rest that the it people would know about but actually it's a whole scene full of other props full of support services why is the tree there for example it's not i.t at all why is it part of the architecture well it is because when you're spending eight hours in a shift focusing trying to guide people to find a missing boy the tree in the middle helps you keep stable keeps you grounded it has its place in the story during the the course one things that we'll do is we stop frequently and use the material we've just looked at to explore how we apply all of this to our to the architecture questions that we've brought with us to the course so that's a quick summary of one part of the material there's a lot more to explore in the course so look forward to seeing you there hope you'll see hope we'll see you soon thanks for
