# Analysis: Enterprise-architecture: a status-report - Episode 72, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video delivers a critical status report on enterprise architecture (EA), asserting that it remains predominantly IT-centric and dominated by outdated frameworks like **TOGAF**, which focus narrowly on infrastructure and business-IT alignment. The speaker warns that these approaches are ill-suited for modern challenges such as cloud, IoT, GDPR, and security, urging an urgent rebuild toward a more holistic, balanced EA within the next decade.

## Key Takeaways
- Current EA is **IT-centric**, originating from and still focused on IT infrastructure, applications, technology, and "big IT" environments, with TOGAF exemplifying this narrow scope.
- Traditional frameworks like TOGAF fail beyond IT because their structure is designed solely for infrastructure, rendering extensions to broader enterprise needs ineffective.
- Modern realities—such as **cloud data centers**, **IoT** (where data, applications, and technology intertwine), and regulations like **GDPR** (emphasizing people alongside IT)—demand a balanced view that current EA cannot provide.
- EA risks irrelevance, including the "enterprise architecture police" mindset, becoming unwanted amid these shifts.
- A **complete rebuild** and new approach to EA is urgently needed to address present needs and prepare for the future over the next decade.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Recognize if an organization is "not really up to the enterprise architecture needs even of the present": Assess reliance on IT-centric frameworks like TOGAF for non-IT contexts, such as IoT or people-focused security.
- Shift focus from **business-IT alignment** to holistic balance: Integrate people, data, applications, and technology without overemphasizing IT.
- Plan for a **full rebuild**: Move beyond IT-dominated models to frameworks suited for cloud, distributed systems, and regulatory demands, starting within the current decade.

## Quotes
- "most of it is to IT centric this is where most people still work though we started my group started moving out of this ten or more years ago but most people still work in this space we're still IT centric it's still dominated by toga"
- "enterprise architecture is business IT alignment and we you can see things like TOGAF is a verb we will talk if your organization is what someone had said it's not really up to the enterprise architecture needs even of the present let alone the future"
- "we have enterprise architecture frameworks that are hopelessly out of date now and almost perfectly unsuited for the real needs that were starting to face"
- "we'll also got a real risk that that kind of enterprise architecture particularly the idea of the enterprise architecture police is becoming completely irrelevant and very much unwanted we have an urgent need for a rebuild and a completely new approach"
