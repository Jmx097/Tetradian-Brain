some Mon ago I did a set of videos about the need for an and method for enterprise architecture that worked essentially the same way everywhere because we cover everything by definition in an enterprise we need a method that does work the same way everywhere that works and every scope and scale every type of content and every type of context that's the actual need we also needed to help us avoid falling into anti patterns of it the classic one of rushing straight into action or rushing straight to a plan without thinking what we're doing and we also need to balance context specific into context neutral the whole point about having something that works in the same way everywhere is that we can keep track of and holds together all the bits that come from all the different spaces that we cover it's not just my team we're covering the business models the operational issues the skills issues the finance operation model everything that we have to cover over interleaving interweaving sets of time and time scales so that's the requirement and what we did with it was developed a method called change mapping which is what I want to look at in this short series of videos now when we look at a task in a Gantt chart actually within the capulet every task is essentially the same it's just a box marked task but what we really want to do is to make sure what happens inside that task is exactly consistent what we need to do is get the right balance between not just doing things right which is often the only focus get an efficient get it exact get it reliable that's the classic focus in most of the issues but what we notice so often it's the issues like scope creep or doing it without actually thinking about what we're doing it for first place so what we need to do is do the right things do them right and also learn from them at every step of the way so that we could learn and adapt dynamically according to changing circumstances what we ended up with was what we called C spa context scope plan passion review and every task is exactly the same for every task no matter how much down the detail level we need to check that we've doing the right context is it the right thing is it on purpose we need to check the scope that we've got the right bit that we're working with and that we're not going to wander off while scope creep go fill into something else completely different unless we intend to do it which we do by iteration we need to make sure that we've got the plan sorted out and that everything is in place for action or as best we can and also that we're doing the action we're capturing the insights the information that we need in order to be able to do a review but then afterwards we do an after-action review of some kind after every single action every task is the same ContiTech the context check the scope work on them if need be get get the plan sorted out do the action in the way that you've specified to make sure you've actually done it do an after-action review every single task the same so we then have what make on a mission wrapper we come in with a question a concern an issue how are we going to do a digital transformation or how are we going to do this sale just something very small to say huge to something very small it's exactly the same so mission X is a kind of wrapper it's actually another C Spire in its own right we've got to do the context what is the context in this question who's going to be working on this question who is going to be doing the exploration on the action how do we make sure this is the right thing and that we've got we get clear about what's going to happen at the end will we check we make sure that we've got benefits real nice and lessons learned after every single action well so who does what one things that we really noticed is that there were rushes into the action but who's keeping track who's the Pathfinder with a guide who's making sure that we stay on track to method that we don't get lost and very often particularly during an exploration when everyone's diving in and exploring who's actually capturing the information that we need the observer who's doing that job so that's what we need inside around every mission making sure that each action that we take is on purpose we know who's doing it who's good what role each person has very much like crew management systems in aircraft each person has a particular role we need to make sure that all the roles we need to covered now all of this has to be iterative it has to be recursive it has to be fractal little mini missions so they're inside missions inside missions which is what we see on a Gantt chart the whole cascade of the tasks within tasks within tasks so that's what we've built and that's what the whole idea of change mapping is about that we always keep track of where we are at all times within any change thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't
