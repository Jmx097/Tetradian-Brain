okay I'm a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Gerber at the intersection of 19 conference the Academy understand see it's in this one and with this I think for thinking is about everything it yes is what is the yeah but I think enterprise architecture has come out of IT community involved the PI engineers by people mainly and it's even after 30 or 30 years it's still long in this famous IT our retirement statistically not many people in the business know that they are Enterprise architects and the people that know enterprise architects don't like animals so what we want to do it what I believe is that must be open to the concept of architecture must get out of this ivory tower it must get opened to many many disciplines because architecture is it like it's a natural you think it's a natural thing for 18 years because when you go to idea to tea University technical university but young analysts to structure things in elements and everything yes that's what you're doing all day long so it's no wonder that it came out from the technical community nowadays I was a digital transformation T and business are thought to merge then I think in ten years there will be no IT department anymore because business entity will get more and more as one for me the it's a logical consequence that the idea of architecture must be done by business people so they're engineering things that to be able to design businesses by elements and relations for me it's a logical but obvious thing that it must shift from the idea to the business sector and that means that we must create it in a more simple way in a usable way so the vision we have is make architecture as use useful less than a headphone use experience is very very important otherwise the things that enterprise architects have created so far they're usually they're bloated metamodels complex diagrams and so on so it's not only that it hasn't worked business side business architecture is there it is a young discipline to be spoken and so on but it hasn't made it to proto audience yep so yeah so this is this is my vision got to make it simple as simple as an iPhone and make it available to many many roles that should start architecture thinking so it's also a mindset it's not just engineering it's just be aware that we are just an element in the business structure and that our relations to other elements you have any particular point about how people should be contacting or I'll shoot people should be connecting with what you are trying to do whatever link in the and the description in YouTube but the any personal things or particular focus that you'd like to see people take a particular focus yeah I want them to feel accountable for the architecture of the whole enterprise so it's shift in mindset it's no longer possible to blame I did that vectors are not okay it's the accountability it should be the accountability of the business people and it's a mindset that they become a way at the beach each level design decisions each and every product launch each and every service they designed to the other world is part of a more realistic picture of the enterprise and once they have this understanding I think architecture will emerge into the business v1 themes the themes I've been pushing is the idea that architecture is about that things work better when they work together yes that's it and so that's what I'm not pushing for that's why I wanted to talk with you yes where you're coming from thank you very much
