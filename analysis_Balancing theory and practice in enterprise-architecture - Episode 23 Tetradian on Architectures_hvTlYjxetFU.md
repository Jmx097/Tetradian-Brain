# Analysis: Balancing theory and practice in enterprise-architecture - Episode 23, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video argues that enterprise architecture theory differs from scientific theory by addressing both repeatable (simple/complicated) and non-repeatable (volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous, or VUCA) aspects of real-world problems, including wicked problems and unique business elements like alchemy. It advocates for "just enough theory" to support practice, akin to pragmatic approaches that inform and refine each other, rather than rigid best practices that fail across contexts.

## Key Takeaways
- Enterprise architecture theory must span repeatable domains (high repeatability, like simple/complicated problems using the **SCAN framework**) and non-repeatable ones (**VUCA**: volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous), distinguishing tame problems (stay solved) from wicked problems (change with context or repetition).
- **Best practices** are context-specific and often fail elsewhere; focus on invariant **factors** that remain consistent across contexts rather than fixed content.
- Unique business elements (e.g., "secret sauce") resist replication, resembling **alchemy** more than science, preserving competitive niches.
- Theory should be **pragmatic**: "just enough theory to support the practice," mirroring concepts like just enough certainty, process, or method, where practice refines theory.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Use the **SCAN framework** to classify problems: identify simple/complicated (repeatable, theory-driven) vs. chaotic/complex (non-repeatable, practice-led).
- When addressing wicked problems, prioritize **invariant factors** over content; analyze what stays consistent across repetitions or contexts rather than assuming direct replication.
- Apply **"just enough" principles** across architecture work: balance theory with practice by starting with minimal theory to guide real-world actions, then iterate based on outcomes.

## Quotes
- "Theory in enterprise architecture is a rather different beast from what you might think of as quote scientific theory it's not about repeatability or rather we need to understand what is repeatable and what is not."
- "Best practice is the best thing that worked for someone else in their context but it doesn't necessarily work the same way with us."
- "When we work with with wicked but with world problems we're looking for the factors that say the same rather than the content that stays the same don't mix them up."
- "There are parts of our work then they're not so much like science but are actually more like alchemy when we're working with the uniqueness rather than the sameness."
- "What we need is just enough theory to support the practice that's where Theory fits is very similar to how we worked with just enough certainty just enough process just enough method."[5][7]
