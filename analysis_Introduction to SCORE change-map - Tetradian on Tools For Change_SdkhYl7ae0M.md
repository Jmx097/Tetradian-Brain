# Analysis: Introduction to SCORE change-map - Tetradian on Tools For Change

## Executive Summary
The video introduces the SCORE change-map tool as a dynamic framework for mapping business issues, using domains like Strengths, Challenges, Options, Responses, and Effectiveness to uncover insights rather than static lists. It demonstrates SCORE's application to a "better customer support" scenario, revealing connections that lead to actionable improvements like enhanced training. Unlike SWOT, SCORE emphasizes iterative connections to generate new ideas and responses.[1]

## Key Takeaways
- SCORE is an acronym for **Strengths** (internal capabilities), **Challenges** (internal issues that can become strengths), **Options** (external opportunities/risks), **Responses** (real-world feedback), and **Effectiveness** (bridge for impact criteria like customer-orientation and cost-effectiveness).[1][3]
- The tool uses a central **focus question** to navigate domains in a "dance-like" process, where items in one domain trigger insights in others, building a connected picture for decision-making.[1][2]
- SCORE serves as a decision-oriented alternative to SWOT, prioritizing **connections and iterations** over lists to reveal hidden issues and opportunities.[1][2][3]
- In the example, perceived strengths like FAQs and call centers fail due to inadequate information delivery, highlighting risks like customer loss and needs for better training.[1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
The video provides a live demonstration of using SCORE as a standalone toolsheet:
1. Start with a **focus question** (e.g., "better customer support") and define **Effectiveness** criteria (e.g., customer-oriented, cost-effective).[1]
2. Map **Responses** from the real world (e.g., "not the right information"), linking to internal **Strengths** (e.g., FAQs, manuals, call center).[1]
3. Identify **Challenges** (e.g., call center follows scripts, not customer needs) and **Risks** under Options (e.g., losing customers).[1]
4. Iterate by bouncing between domains: resolve Challenges with cost-effective training for experienced staff, creating new **Options** like sales/consulting opportunities, and test via Responses.[1][2]
5. Use the process to generate insights and actions, such as rethinking call center roles for non-standard queries.[1]

## Quotes
- "SCORE itself is an acronym for Strengths, Challenges, Options, Responses, Effectiveness - the 'domains' of the toolsheet."[1]
- "Rather than just making lists we're using the categories to lead us around in a dance to see where it leads each thing leads to the others and we build a new picture."[1]
- "The key difference is that in SWOT the emphasis is on making lists, whereas in SCORE it's more about making connections - which then lead to the insights that we need."[1]
