# Analysis: Enterprise Architecture and Coronavirus: Kurtosis-risk: Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary

This video explores **kurtosis-risk** (long-tail risk) as a critical consideration for enterprise architects, particularly in the context of systemic vulnerabilities exposed by crises like the coronavirus pandemic. The speaker argues that while individual instances of poor practices may appear low-risk, their repetition compounds exponentially, creating catastrophic consequences when the risk eventually materializes—and that enterprise architects must identify and mitigate these structural risks through checks and balances.

## Key Takeaways

- **Kurtosis-risk definition**: A known unknown with apparently low probability but extremely high impact; also called "long-tail risk" or "fat-tail risk"[1][2]

- **Compounding effect**: Individual low-probability risks become nearly certain when repeated multiple times across a system; the cumulative risk grows rapidly with repetition

- **Social media amplification**: Modern digital platforms transform localized service failures into viral crises with exponential reputational damage (e.g., "United Breaks Guitars")

- **Structural vulnerability patterns**: Risks emerge when systems are designed around propping oneself up by putting others down or offloading responsibility onto others

- **Business examples provided**:
  - Poor customer service creating industry-wide reputational damage
  - Radio pranks with tragic human consequences
  - Predatory lending practices that destroyed institutional trust in six months

- **Mitigation strategy**: Establish robust **mutual responsibilities** with fully functioning checks and balances to identify and address structural vulnerabilities before they compound

- **Enterprise architect responsibility**: These risks require serious attention because they can destroy entire businesses and organizations

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials

**Risk Identification Process:**
1. Identify the structural factors that create repetitive low-probability events
2. Recognize patterns where gains come from disadvantaging others or shifting accountability
3. Calculate cumulative risk rather than treating each instance independently
4. Assess whether the cost of ignoring the risk exceeds mitigation expenses

**Risk Mitigation Framework:**
1. Map mutual responsibilities across the enterprise architecture
2. Design robust checks and balances into critical processes
3. Ensure accountability cannot be offloaded to external parties
4. Regularly audit systems for designs that benefit one stakeholder at another's expense

## Quotes

- "Kurtosis risk is otherwise known as a long tail risk is a known unknown with apparently low low probability but a very high impact so that the effective gains that we make by ignoring the risk can be wiped out and often vastly more when the risk actually eventuates"

- "The important point about a kurtosis risk is particularly around repetition... as an individual instance the risk may be very low probability but when it's repeated and repeated and repeated the risk rises quite rapidly till it becomes almost certain"

- "The costs of ignoring structural issues like this can be enormous and the more it goes on the longer it runs the higher the risk grows"

- "If you have something that's designed on propping someone else but propping self up by putting someone else down or offloading responsibility onto another these are kurtosis risks that can destroy a business"

- "Enterprise architects need to take these risks very seriously indeed"
