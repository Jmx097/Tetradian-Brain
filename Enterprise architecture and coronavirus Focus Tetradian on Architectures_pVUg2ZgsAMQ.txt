when things get disruptive it's easy to lose focus it's easy to get lost in panic or overt particularly when you're the only group out of a larger group that is suddenly having to deal with massive overload and also if your organization is mostly used to things being stable and always the same so it's very easy to get lost to panic the thing that helps keep the panic at bay is some kind of focus something that gives an anchor or more accurately something more like a sheet anchor in nautical terms in other words it's not something that holds us rigidly still but it gives us a sense of some sort of stability some sort of directional focus she thanked her is literally a sheet of a kind of parachute was dropped out of the back of a ship above a sailing sailing ship to keep it more stable than the heavy winds and heavy currents so one example of this one example of a focus the one I recommend most is a focus on vision values and principles know often for this the example I use is the TED Conference ideas worth spreading that's their big it tells us that the focus that we're going to work on is ideas that's the access from the focus area what activity is about spreading ideas and we concentrate on the ideas that are worth spray that's how that that first one about focusing on we're focusing on ideas helps us avoid scope creep we don't get lost trying to do something else the focus on spreading ideas means that we're again it helps us avoid scope creep or context loss but the other one about worth these are ideas that are worth spreading is that this tells us what the values are is the simple test is is this an idea that's worth spreading how do we assess whether this is worth spreading so that gives us a guidance of to test anything that's going on chaotic in a chaotic environment it seems like everything is possible what could be looking anywhere go crazy bring it back down to what is the focus of this business we deliver bread we do we focus on bread that matters bread that is good here's a good one for a baker we are in the story of and this is all worth that's useful that's well that's useful here is they the enterprise has story we are in the story of bread that is high quality bread that is worth eating bread that is gluten-free for example but which is maybe very important for some people to know that that's safe to eat in the midst of chaos we don't want to add someone who's having an allergy attack in the middle of a pandemic so we're using the vision the anglers anchor short anchor phrase what is everyone working with or working on what are you doing what are you doing relative to the big story in relation to that overall thing and how do you assess that it's worthwhile doing what is your measure of success that's gives you an anchor a vision it gives the values that fall out of that and the principles are the actionable values that we can then test am I on track to division am I on track to the values am i holding the values that's what we're doing there if we don't have a vision or if as is too often the case that the vision is actually just a marketing puff as in our vision is to be the biggest provider off it's not about you it's about the organize about the whole enterprise it's the view from the outside looking out and occasionally looking in rather than looking from the inside the organization looking out at what you can sell it's a quite different type of vision than the one that's usually described so it's not a marketing pitch week we are serving that and this is a where another useful one if you don't have a clear vision but useful one to focus on is the idea of service how do we serve who do we serve what is our service in what way do we serve the whole of the wider story if we're in a broader enterprise then playing a role in that enterprise how can we connect with all of the other players in that story to make it happen how do we make sure that others are there how can we support others who are struggling in our own shoshone enterprise because if they're struggling they're going to get us struggling eventually as well so it's in our interest to notice the whole story and how it connects what we can do to do to serve that story better sort of who do you serve you don't have business just solely to make shareholders make money that's oh really that's a side effect of doing your job well if you have shareholders it's not your job is not to make the bank happy your job is to do some kind of service to a broader enterprise you will keep the back happy by doing it properly but who do you serve what values define what services what do whenever you're in an interaction with others to make enough service happen what are your mutual responsibilities but classic terms and conditions it tends to be very one-sided it looks the world only from the organization's perspective to get service happening we need to be symmetrical to be balanced what are the checks and balances that make your service work how do you identify what is good or not good service what does good service look like what is not good service look like how do you tell the difference what could you do on the fly to maintain good service or to bend things towards serving in the way that you would like how do you maintain service when little bits of disruption are happening all around the place but for example a just-in-time manufacturing and just-in-time supply chain gives you a real problem there's some parts of the supply chain are randomly breaking it's going it means that you're going to need things like buffers in your system warehouses and so on to make this possible how are you going to deal with disruption in this little ways how can it maintain service so there's two focused themes that you can use to avoid to minimize and avoid the Govardhana the risk of falling into panic one of them is to keep a focus on vision values and principles another is to focus on the idea of service and how you serve your community your story
