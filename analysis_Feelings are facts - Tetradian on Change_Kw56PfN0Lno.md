# Analysis: Feelings are facts - Tetradian on Change

## Executive Summary

The speaker argues that feelings are objective facts about our internal experience, while opinions and beliefs about those feelings are not facts. The core insight is that individuals are solely responsible for managing their own emotions, and demanding that others create circumstances to eliminate our fears places responsibility elsewhere and ultimately disempowers us.

## Key Takeaways

- **Feelings are facts; beliefs about feelings are not** — What we feel is real and undeniable, but interpretations about what those feelings mean are subjective.
- **Personal responsibility for emotions** — Only you can change your own feelings; you cannot offload this responsibility to others or demand that they manage your emotional experience.
- **The paradox of external control** — Attempting to make others responsible for your emotional state actually reinforces powerlessness and intensifies fear.
- **Fear loops are self-perpetuating** — When fear becomes addictive or habitual (an "awfulization loop"), external circumstances alone cannot resolve it.
- **Practical application in change management** — Recognizing feelings as personal facts creates space for meaningful action and shifts in how we approach conflict and change.

## Actionable Insights

**Reframing responsibility for emotions:**
1. Identify a fear or worry you're experiencing
2. Recognize it as a fact about your current internal state (not about external reality)
3. Accept that only you can shift this feeling
4. Ask: "What action can I take to change how I feel?" rather than "What can others do to make me feel safe?"

**Avoiding the disempowerment trap:**
- When you demand that others create circumstances to eliminate your fear, you transfer responsibility away from yourself, which paradoxically increases feelings of powerlessness
- Instead, focus on what is within your control: your responses, interpretations, and actions

## Quotes

- "What you feel, what you perceive is your own truth — it's not necessarily anyone else's."
- "The only person who is responsible for changing those feelings is ourselves. We can't offload it to someone else."
- "Demanding that others produce circumstances where only you do not feel afraid doesn't actually help anyone, including you, because it's requiring that we take responsibility from you for those feelings, which then emphasizes that you feel powerless, which will re-feed the fear."
- "Once we realize that feelings are facts and are personal, that gives us an option to shift — an obvious place to move, a place where we can make things happen."
