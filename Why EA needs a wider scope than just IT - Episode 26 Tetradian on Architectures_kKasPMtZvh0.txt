for this episode the question comes from Alan Lloyd who asks me why do I keep saying that enterprise architecture needs to be wider than IT because most existing framework enterprise architecture frameworks do focus almost in clarity on i.t well the first part of the answer is that anything we're dealing with in an enterprise is a complex system and a complex systems do not have a single center everything and noth-nothing is the center all at the same time so if we demand that there be a single center we're in trouble straight away well so a lot of the key complexity that we face may be outside a mighty anyway for example a major change for IT in the recent time has been the the European Union's GDP are the general data protection regulation which is an item of regulation that's caused massive change right the way across anything that deals with information shared across the net so we often need to think much broader about the impacts on where they come from which means we need to start outside of my team also another problem is that IT centralism completely miss constrains their view of the whole if we take the classic B Nasdaq business data applications technology but then in effect what it's saying is that the only things we need to be concerned about at the MIT and it defines business architecture as sort of anything not IT that might affect IT it's actually like looking upward from the bottom of a well where the focus in this case is IT hardware IT infrastructure but if we were to go above the well and keep on going we get a very different view than this very narrow view that we get from looking upward from the bottom of the well so whole enterprise view requires us to look at the people issues the physical asset issues the information issues many of which can be beyond IT itself and also what the real dry as the human drivers the human enterprise another concern that we have and when we're dealing with whole enterprise architectures is what we call fungibility the interchangeability of things this is particularly important in terms of disaster recovery and business continuity where for example in it is in a disaster environment we meet many to replace the IT boxes with human processes equally in a process redesign what we're trying to do is replace human with IT as much as we can so the things we need to understand how the process works separately from the IT before we think about plugging the IT into the box we cannot do that if we hold a rigidly IT centric view of the world and also there's some interesting cases where we want to deliberately focus on the human side because of issues around risk responsibility in both in legal terms and in others as well so for example playing a Kanban environment often we actually prefer a physical box of physical rack of cards because the action of taking a card out and saying this is now finished has a very different feel on a very different commitment and responsibility when we are moving when we're committing to move something it has a rate of a feel when we're doing it in a physical environment from when we do from simply pushing a button so sometimes we want deliberately to include the human and the physical rather than purely the electronic or the IT so those are the main reasons we most of our frameworks are stuck focused on IT but many very often we will need to see the enterprise far beyond just the IT boxes and sometimes we want to be able to deliberately focus on something else rather than just the IT where the IT becomes solely the enabler these are the main reasons why in enterprise architecture we do need to think wider than just IT
