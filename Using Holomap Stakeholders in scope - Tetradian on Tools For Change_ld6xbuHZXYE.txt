in this set of videos we're looking at a tool called the holomap whose job it is to help us map out who the stakeholders are in an enterprise and what our relationships are with with each of them the first video in this set we looked at the the content of an enterprise in this case the ten videos that take conferences of ideas worth spreading well one of the things the actions the locations the people the events and the decisions are within that overall enterprise kind of summary or overview in the next video we've started mapping them out in terms of who are these people in each case there is someone who's dealing with the things someone who's doing actions someone who's doing the location in managing the hutt locations someone who's dealing with particular events and so on so who are all these people who are they that's what we needed to get a big picture or the context of the overall enterprise so in this video we'll take that the next step on and start looking at what are the responsibilities and relationships with the with each of the players where we position ourselves within that enterprise now in this case we talked about that we were we were a social media provider so for each of those players what is our relationship with them what are the receipt of things responsibility accountability consulted informed and what is their distance from us how much are they direct interactions do we transact with them and so on this is where the holomap really comes that comes in as a different distinct tool because we described it in terms of three quite distinct layers the first layer we look at who are our suppliers the transactions who are our suppliers who are our customers directly from that set of print promotional material customer service and so on so our customers often will have a kind of indirect step which is customers customer and supplier supplier so a lot of our stuff is two-stage because the definition of customer for social media is both the person using the social media but also the person monitoring it and often the person who actually pays us is not the person who's using the social media but the person who's monitoring it so the relationships are different in fact we don't really have a direct connection often with our individual people other than if we're supporting customer service so the individual users of social media we don't necessarily provide they are actually providers to us beyond that the next day so that's transactions beyond that what we might call direct interaction these are people that we need or that we interact with but not really as part of our main value stream they're people like the educate the the trainers recruiters how are we going to find people to run our social media operation who are going to train the people up in the particular tasks that we need to be done there's regulators are various kinds there are journalists who we need to help us work with the social media area this technology supplier cells technology suppliers down here somewhere take a provider hosting providers all that and we also have competitors we've got to think of as being out in that space so we're getting the site and an idea of what our relationships are the distance they are further out there are things like families there's things like holidays vacations what happens if a family member is ill what happens if there is a problem generally around so these are indirect in direct transactions that can affect us a lot and this is areas like for example it includes things like government what are the rules that we have to operate under not just specific to our industry but more generally things like tax things like planning law and so on that about how our operation can work we've also got this issue I mentioned before about anti clients people who disagree fundamentally with what it is that we're doing now these are extremely important in social media one of our jobs is to track them identify who they are so this is although they are a distant relationship this is extremely important because we usually identify an anti client through social media someone who's strongly disagreeing with how the how the business our business operates or have the business that we are supporting in social media will operate also to consider are any investors and any beneficiaries not necessarily the same people so as we've mapped this out what we now want to do is what are the responsibilities for each what is each of these people responsible for in terms of the overall story and in terms of what we need to do so a regulator is responsible for regulating our industry we have to follow the standards so that's another one we need to look at is standards bodies what are the standards that apply to our industry so we are mapping out what each of these relationships will involve who's responsible for what who's accountable for what what part do they play in the overall story in this case of ideas worth spreading we're just doing the social media bit others are doing other parts of it what are our relationships with each of these players that we've identified previously as being part of the overall story the purpose of all of this is not just to look at what who they are but each one of these in applies a project a process or a service each one of these says that there is going to be some kind of interaction going on some kind of direct transaction some interaction some more distant interaction what are the responsibilities of each of the players here that's what we do when we're plotting up the scope or using holomap to plot out the scope of what we're going to do for a project or a plan thanks for watching do look at the youtube description for links to further detail
