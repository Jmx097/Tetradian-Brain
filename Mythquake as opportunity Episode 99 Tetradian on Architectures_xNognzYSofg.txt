continuing on with the theme of myth quakes in this episode I want to emphasize that myth quakes aren't necessarily bad in fact very often a myth quake presents us with a very real opportunity what to reprise first that a myth is a an assumption which is either has been either unverified or untested and a myth quake occurs when our assumption meets up with reality and has a conflict with reality we've also got a myth quake scale - that allows us to measure the potential severity or potential impact of myth quakes and also what to look at the idea of myth quake preparedness that myth quakes can actually be good first point here is that risk and opportunity are always flip sides of each other whenever we have a risk there's always an opportunity whenever there's an opportunity there's always a risk we need to always look at them as a balanced pair so whenever we look at a myth quake we're looking for the opportunity in there as well as the risk in fact we can look at it in terms of comedy versus tragedy comedy is arises from myth quakes seen as opportunity a lot of humor for example depends on a clash of assumptions tragedy arises when people refuse to face the myth quake when they've refused to face the implications of a clash between their assumptions and reality and the refusal also intensifies the potential of the myth quake every time we refuse to look at a myth quake we increase the risk we increase the level that the impact that it could have now when we want myth quakes are in things like skills development we need to salt to present and resolve a myth quake that allows it to shift from I can't - I can we have a clash between the assumption of I can't creating I can we also want myth quakes to help us to break out of stuckness I can't do this I can't move forward the myth quake occurs whenever we discover that we can move forward this is something that we want to happen so we need to be able to challenge our own assumptions create our own myth quakes in order to move forward we want to open up new possibilities new opportunities every risk of a myth quake also implies an opportunity but we also want to test for risk but a rather than simply running headlong into the myth quake because every opportunity provides a risk or implies a risk so we need to see myth quakes not just as something bad but actually something that helps us a lot something that helps us break our assumptions is often very useful indeed
