what's the shape of your change what shape does it make as it moves through the landscape of possibilities imagine it being like a flow moving down a river or a chunk like a flood moving down carving its own shape in the landscape is it like a glacier pushing through producing this great u-shaped structure it's like a fast-moving river carving a narrow groove if we think of the breadth of that change as being the scope that it has within the overall scope of all possibility the length being how much of it is all happening at the same time carving its own path the depth is like the intensity of it is it gentle or is it fast moving is it carving as fast as it can go like an agile environment what shape does it take if we look at the shape that it's making in the landscape as a whole has it got a clear sense of direction is it pushing through regardless in one particular direction is it having to maneuver and bend around major obstacles is it meandering all over the place is it wondering we have no idea where which often happens in a in a business environment is it does it have any kind of direction at all are you putting out scouts to look out ahead for what the possible issues might be that you have to maneuver around do you have scouts working up the paths through the possible paths through the mountain the passes and also what terrain is it moving through is it moving through a smooth easy landscape i remember someone said it was like we have straight paths of change going through or is it harder going is it actually dealing with the real world rather than imaginary flat nothingness is it going through a swamp is it struggling over a scree where you can hardly get any footing and whatever you do you keep on sliding back is it hard going over mountains are you having to do lots of little river crossings what is the shape of your change and then when you look at the group that are doing the change are they all grouped together in a bunch are they all strung out in different places like the scouts that you've sent ahead the ones that are doing the cleanup behind how are you keeping everyone together on that same path to make sure they don't all break up and go off into their own directions so what's the shape of your change it's a useful metaphor to explore when trying to make sense of change
