there's an Enterprise Architect I'm happy to use any model that's around if it will help me solve a particular problem one of the most interesting models are come across is also one of them very oldest it's several thousand years old the old Chinese five elements model there's no real example of how I used it in a live problem about conflict resolution this was a place that worked out where it was essentially a research lab but full of scientists and someone needed to bring a bunch of engineers in from another area of another department well they said they'll get on fine there were technical they'll get on like a house on fire well they did flames explosions out loud shrieks manga it was definitely gone like house on fire the point was that there was a natural clash going on and one of the things that Illustrated it very well was the Chinese five elements model wood fire earth metal water in essence the scientists were wood they were all ideas springing up new ideas coming up all the time the engineers were metal they want to get things done now now budget get up get up fundamental clash in the way they were looking at the world and again in Chinese five elements ours would eventually fractures metal and stone in the original but metal shots down wood we can see straightaway which one's going to win and that's going to cause huge damage to the organization so again using the five elements perspective how about filling in the gaps and the gaps were we've got wood clashing with metals so what's the other ones fire earth water fire is about the explosions about the flames about the arguments the earth is about settling down to a plan settling things down but water is about housing come apart and statics and rebuild to start and feed the new so what we did was we said the clash isn't natural it's no one's fault its inherent in the way that they look at the world so what we need is to recognize that there is a natural clash here and acknowledged that the conflict is inherent so we've got to deal with the conflict we shouldn't be trying to shut it down the next was looking at how the plans worked for the particular clash area was about scheduling the service kept on changing what they were giving to the the engineers just as the engineers were about to start it drove them mad but agreeing a different type of scheduling where everyone could see what was going on and the scientists had some room for manoeuvre but not randomly changing things that kept the engineers happy and still gave the scientists the flexibility that they needed and going the other direction the output from the start of the engineers work was a set of engineering reports we got those restructured so that they would more naturally fit with how the scientists worked it was much more structured much more accessible much more reusable rather than just an end report and that's that so it became a feat each one fed the next so each of these things the wood fed the fire the new foot in the news of new circumstances but we had a structure in place to deal with the clashes and acknowledge what they were fire comes to ash to earth that was the scheduling the planning that went there but we got clear on how the shelling was to be managed the earth fed the metal fenders done it kept the engineers happy in their work and the output from the engineers produced the end results which now fed into the scientists work it became a virtuous supportive cycle so even a very like Chinese five elements can be really useful in an enterprise architecture environment thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
