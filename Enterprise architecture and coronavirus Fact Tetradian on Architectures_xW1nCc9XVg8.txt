and yes another theme that's come up with coronavirus is the whole question of the fact what is fact and particularly how can we make decisions based on very incomplete sense of fact incomplete information there's a real challenge there because most businesses are based on the idea that we're supposed to know the answers without question and that we are the absolute authority any decisions who make it good to be correct but how can we do that well we don't have the facts that we need one things about the current of Eros is that but there's a lot of things we don't know we don't know just how its transmitted we still don't know half the information many of our policies that are around are based on information that's already out of date and we don't know most of the risks so what can we do and particularly as Enterprise architects how can we make this better because it's highlighted the problem about incomplete information anyway what can we trust as fact a lot of the information that we need is missing anyway now what do we do so we've also got to deal with the fact that sometimes the information we need is being what's that phrase economical with the truth I think was one of the phrases that was used a long time ago so the solutions are here around that we can't make accurate decisions based on incomplete information so how do we deal with it the first one is that perhaps is the purpose of very real emotional issues here when people have been required for the whole of their working lives to get things right then suddenly faced with situations where they cannot get it right and where people may well die or certainly be harmed if they make the wrong decision then there's some huge emotional challenges we've got to face this we've got to be honest about this guilt for example is really not helpful it's the reality is that we cannot be expected to be exactly correct when the information about working with is incomplete there's a very good illustration of how to do it right came out of the Walmart CEO his response to the Hurricane Katrina catastrophe in New Orleans that he said this company will rise to the challenge do the best you can with the information you have that the company will support you and a lot of you are going to have to make decisions well above your level do the best you can and that's a very good very honest response we have to be willing to accept and work with the support people in making decisions in difficult circumstances one of the greatest challenges here is the problem of I would use it in a technical sense the problem of incompetence someone who's competent knows what they're doing someone who is not competent doesn't know what they're doing the most dangerous person of the lot is the person who believes they know what they're doing when they don't those are the people against very deeply into trouble and cause enormous disasters but still believe that they know exactly what they're doing so we need to treasure our non competence we need to work with and accept that we are not competent and do it anyway knowing that we are not competent to do this but accepting our job then is to learn how to do it better with those circumstances now there are tools that can help one of the tools that I produced is called scan helps us map out what the uncertainties are how much time we've got to reduce some at least of the uncertainty to something resembling known or knowable and before we get down to the point where we're going to hit pad how to deal with deep uncertainty we need a vision we need support at the emotional level and the principles level the guidelines to help us in deep uncertainty when we're making decisions in real time so these matter a lot we need to have those ready now as Enterprise architects and business architects we need to make sure those things are in place to help people as best we can during periods of deep uncertainty so those are the challenges how do we help people get the right decisions or good enough decisions rather than trying to fix everything in ways that we can't because especially when we simply don't have time that's our challenge how can we help people make the right decisions under conditions of deep uncertainty
