hi welcome back to tech trading on architectures the question this time is again from Emma Court and she asks well what is it that real architects actually do should we for example just follow the frameworks that already exist well man sir that is the frameworks are useful but there may be sort of checklist some guidance they're not about the actual work that happens if we go back to a previous theme that things work better when they work together on purpose then some of the things that we need to focus on that we need to link together is actually people so the larger the scope we grow the broader we make it the more important that the soft skills become at an enterprise architecture level often the soft skills are much more important just than the technical skills alone the other question Emma asked was where do we see most business impact of architecture and this one's tricky because rather like an event organizer the better an architect does their work the better things work together which means that the better things work together the less problems that we see so I have this slightly awkward situation where the better we do our work the less visible it becomes which is a bit awkward bit unfair so a key metric here is that we can see that things and people are working together better more on purpose and also that people are happier they're more willing to connect more willing to make connections themselves across the whole space so I hope that's useful things what we shall be follow the frameworks no it's mostly mostly about the people skills the soft skills rather than purely of the technical ones and where do we see most business impact the real impact of architecture is when things work better which means that problems are less dominant less there's much less chaos going around in the space
