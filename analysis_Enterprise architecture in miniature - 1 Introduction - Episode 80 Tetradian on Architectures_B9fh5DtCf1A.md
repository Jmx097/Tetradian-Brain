# Analysis: Enterprise architecture in miniature - 1: Introduction - Episode 80, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video introduces applying **enterprise architecture principles** to a one-person organization, using the speaker's van-life setup as a practical example of scaling architecture from planetary levels down to individual constraints. It emphasizes fitting diverse functions like travel, research, engagement, living, and IT into a tiny space, highlighting that architecture must encompass the **entire enterprise story** beyond just IT.[5][4]

## Key Takeaways
- Enterprise architecture principles apply uniformly **at every scope and scale**, from massive planetary systems to a single person's operations.[1][4]
- A one-person enterprise faces **tight practical constraints**, such as vehicle size limits (under 3.5 tonnes, ~1-1.5 tons payload, 11-15 feet long, 5.5 feet wide), requiring multi-use spaces for work, video production, engagement, eating, sleeping, and storage.[5]
- Architecture must address the **full story** of the enterprise—including travel, research, documentation (writing, video, voice), living needs, and mobility—not just IT, which is only a supporting element like communications and internet.[5][1]
- Classic enterprise architecture's **IT-centrism** is insufficient; true architecture covers all functions working together in a unified whole.[5][2]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Start architecture from the **story perspective**: Define the enterprise's core needs (e.g., travel, research, engage people, document via writing/video/voice, eat/live/rest/play) and constraints (e.g., driving license limits vehicle to 3.5 tonnes).[5][1]
- Design for **multiple functions in shared space**: Fit work (writing, video recording/editing, engagement), mobility, and living into ~11-15 feet length and 5.5 feet width, ensuring all elements support each other without silos.[5]
- Use the setup as a **live demonstrator** for whole-enterprise architecture, testing principles across scopes like function (mobility, power, storage) and use (work, rest, move).[1]

## Quotes
- "one of the themes I've promoted right the way through all of my work in enterprise architecture is that we should be able to apply the same principles at every scope and scale"[5]
- "I've got to fit multiple uses into that space into a very small space... I've got to be able to write in there I've got to be able to record video edit video I've got to engage people I've got to move around from place to place and again I've got to be able to eat sleep"[5]
- "when we compare that to classic enterprise architecture which focuses pretty much only on IT yes IT is part of this... but straightaway it should be obvious I hope that there's vastly more here than just the IT and so the architecture of this enterprise has to cover the whole story not merely centered around a team"[5]
