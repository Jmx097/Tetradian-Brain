# Analysis: Enterprise architecture and coronavirus: Antiproperty: Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video introduces the concept of **antiproperty**—the offloading of problems and consequences onto others—as a core cultural and economic issue highlighted by cleaner air during isolation and mining wreckage in Bendigo, Australia. It critiques business models reliant on **externalities**, warning that such practices are unsustainable in a finite system, especially amid the coronavirus crisis. Enterprise architects must examine their organization's antiproperty to ensure business model resilience when externalities rebound.

## Key Takeaways
- **Antiproperty** is the counterpart to property ("mine"), defined as "everyone else's problem," where individuals or organizations extract value while dumping consequences on others, embedded in culture and economics.
- Historical gold mining exemplifies this: profitable at 0.03% yield (a third of an ounce per tonne of quartz), leaving 99.999% as waste externalized to others.
- Many business models depend on **externalities**, such as car pollution, leading to systemic overload; this poisons economies in finite systems and cannot be indefinitely ignored.
- Coronavirus reflections underscore urgency: organizations must assess antiproperty they produce and risks if others reject responsibility, rendering models unsustainable.
- Enterprise and business architects face direct implications—if externalization fails, businesses collapse, demanding proactive modeling of global unsustainability risks.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Identify **antiproperty** in your organization: audit current practices for offloaded responsibilities, such as waste, pollution, or deferred costs dumped on suppliers, communities, or the environment.
- Assess business model vulnerabilities: evaluate what happens if external parties "pass the problem back," using enterprise architecture tools to map dependencies and simulate rebound scenarios.
- Explore sustainability: review operations for reliance on externalities (e.g., economics of car use or mining), and redesign models to internalize costs before systemic failure, as prompted by coronavirus disruptions.

## Quotes
- "Property is mine it's mine auntie property is everyone else's it's somebody else's problem I get what I want somebody else has to deal with the consequences."
- "In economics we refer to this as externalities but it's actually much more much more than just external we've externalize the costs."
- "When you have an economics that depends all this you're ending up eventually with an economics that is going to poison itself into oblivion it's not sustainable in a finite system."
- "For Enterprise architects and business architects it seems like a definitely a good idea to start exploring what anti property our organization is trying is currently developing is currently dumping on others and one of the risks when it starts coming back."[1][2][6]
