# Analysis: DevOps, developers and architecture - Episode 19, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The speaker addresses a viewer's observation that teams rely more on developers than architects in modern DevOps contexts, arguing against the misconception that architecture is solely "big design up front." Instead, architecture provides essential "just enough" big-picture guidance to ensure iterative development aligns with long-term viability, proposing "octopops" as a holistic alternative to DevOps for continuous connection between vision and execution.

## Key Takeaways
- Architecture differs from design: architecture looks "upward" to the big picture, while design looks "downward" to implementation—they are interconnected sides of the same coin.
- Avoid excessive "big design up front," but implement **just enough architecture** to prevent disjointed development where teams rush in multiple directions without connectivity.
- Focus architecture on **key decisions** about elements expensive to change, including costs in money, time, technology, operations, and trade-offs like capex vs. opex.
- Maintain big-picture awareness throughout detailed work to ensure components connect effectively.
- Replace or extend DevOps with **octopops**, enabling complete, continuous linkage from high-level vision to real-world execution and vice versa.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Periodically "look upward" from development details to the architecture level to verify alignment with the overall big picture.
- Prioritize architectural input on high-impact decisions early: assess change costs across financial, temporal, technological, and operational dimensions, including capex-opex balances, to avoid costly rework.
- Adopt an "octopops" mindset in teams: foster bidirectional flow between strategic architecture and tactical DevOps/developer operations for sustained coherence.

## Quotes
- "Architecture in essence looks upward towards the big picture whereas design looks downward towards making it real but they're always the same thing it's just flip sides of the same coin."
- "What we need here is just enough architecture a great big design up front is unhelpful but we need we do need just enough to make sure everything connects to the big picture."
- "We need from architecture is the key decisions about what's going to be expensive to change expensive in terms of not just money but also time in terms of technology in terms of future operational costs."
- "In essence what we need is not so much DevOps as octopops a complete continuous connection all the way through from big picture to real world and back again."
