another important question this time from me Kloss janowska what's the role if any of enterprise architecture within an agile startup well the short answer is if you're familiar with TOGAF the open group architecture framework the short answer is TOGAF done right what we need in TOGAF is for us an agile startup is much more focus on intent which is face a on phases E&amp;G about execution of the architecture and also phase H about really looking context the other thing that we need is a proper iteration and fractality it's sort of covered in TOGAF but not very well toga Fez presented looks like it's something that's designed for larger organizations only and a typical cycle takes two years whereas when we did a revised version of TOGAF we could get the cycle down to under an hour and use the same approach whether we're talking about so an overall process lasting years or things that we could quick review for an hour or less five elements cycle which comes down to a one minute checklist of why who how what on what are the outcomes the other crucial thing that is absolutely essential particularly in an agile startup is situational awareness but sort of covered very loosely in phase H where they talk about looking at the technology landscape but a better way something called Wardley Maps some developed by Simon Wadley which map out in relation each of your capabilities and the things that you're going to link together in terms of whether they're a genesis and new development something that is bespoke something that is essentially bought as a service and something that is bought as a commodity those different approaches that different areas so how they work over time because technologies tend to move over time towards becoming a commodity a pre-production environment so that we get our best development we get our best value by noticing what is new and specific to that what we're developing in this startup but making the best use of the commodities and the services that exist to keep our costs down and our scaling available as well yes the other one we need particularly in a start-up is a very much stronger emphasis on performance the focus on benefits realized and lessons learned because without those two we can't learn from each of our failures it's not fail to learn fail to learn but fail , to learn otherwise we fail to learn and will kill our startup so the architecture provides the big picture but also a systematic method for understanding and learning as we develop and as we go along that's particularly the role of enterprise architecture approaches as used within an agile startup
