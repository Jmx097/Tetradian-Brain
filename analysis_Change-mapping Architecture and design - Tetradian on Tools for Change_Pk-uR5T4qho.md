# Analysis: Change-mapping: Architecture and design - Tetradian on Tools for Change

## Executive Summary
The video introduces change-mapping as a universal, consistent framework applicable to all stages from architecture to design and operations, emphasizing its core cycle of context, scope, plan, action, and review. It distinguishes architecture as upward-focused on abstract principles of how things work together, while design drills down to practical implementation levels. This approach enables chaining, branching, and nesting missions to manage complexity, prevent scope creep, and maintain purpose across contexts like IT, finance, or HR.

## Key Takeaways
- Change-mapping applies universally to **everything**, including exploration, exploitation, architecture (abstract, upward-looking), and design (concrete, downward implementation from logical to physical structures and deployment).
- Core cycle remains identical for every task: **check context, scope, plan, action, review**, then iterate, regardless of scale or mission.
- Supports **chaining** (sequencing missions from big-picture architecture down Zachman layers to operations), **branching** (parallel scopes/plans/actions to resolve uncertainties like unknown unknowns), and **nesting** (mini-missions with context-specific plugins/tools for industries like banking or telecoms).
- Maintains consistency to prevent scope creep, track purpose, and handle rising complexity, even in DevOps across multiple timescales.
- Results loop back, linking branches, enabling a seamless flow from architecture through design to operations.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Follow the universal change-mapping cycle for any task: **1. Check context** (big-picture purpose), **2. Define scope**, **3. Do the plan**, **4. Execute action**, **5. Review and listen**, then **iterate**.
- Chain missions progressively: Start with high-level "should we do this?" (architecture), then "basics of how" (design), down to fine operational details, drawing on prior outputs.
- Branch sideways for multiple scopes within a context, or multiple plans/actions within a scope, especially to convert unknowns to knowns.
- Nest context-specific tools as plugins (e.g., finance models vs. IT or HR tools) into mini-missions: Fire off sub-missions for unknowns while keeping the core cycle intact.
- Loop results back consistently at every scope, scale, and timescale to link branches and sustain sanity amid complexity.

## Quotes
- "The principle is that we actually use it for **everything** that's particularly applies to the crucial distinctions between architecture and design we want to use it for both."
- "Architecture always looks **upward to the abstract** how do things work together better more on purpose design goes **down to the real** how are we actually going to do it."
- "Every single task works exactly the same way in change mapping we're always going to **check context scope do the plan do the action do the review listen let's iterate round**."
- "It also helps us to **keep on track to purpose and to prevent scope creep** so we're using this consistently every scope every scale."
- "Change mapping is **completely consistent** whether we're doing architecture design or whatever it's the detail tools that we call in the change but we're Handel Magnus a consistent way as well the core methods hold them all together is always the same every scope every scale every type of context."
