the topic this time is about service-oriented enterprise architecture now the context here is that one of the Gartner honor analysts came up with the phrase the other day saying service-oriented architecture is dead there's no references to it anywhere well as far as I'm concerned tsoumas oriented architecture has barely got started and opposite picked up from a comment from peter mullan to consider there's a bridge one of the few ways we have a bridge between business and technology so it may be dead in IT alone but it's certainly not dead in enterprise architecture the crucial point here is the idea of the term service or the meaning of the word service once we think of it as being something that serves then it leads us to the idea that everything either is or represents or implies existence of a service this gives us a quick intro into service oriented approaches such as the one i well i developed called enterprise canvas which in which we say that there is a tension between what there is on what exists a service exists to ease that tension to lead us towards the desired ends we then have the relationship between others who can help us reach towards our goals and the ways in which what we deliver can help others reach towards their goals each of these is a service we serve each other but also connecting to purpose so we can map out the entirety of anything any system any context in terms of services because this service connects to that service connects to that service is implemented by that service is to mentally but so is data services information services people services machine mosts most services plant services it core ecology services economic services support services values services they are all services everything connects to everything else as services a service is something that serves so where does a product fit into this what the product is effectively a frozen service whenever two services cannot connect directly together then there must be something that bridges the gap that's what a product does a product is a gap an asynchronous or dislocated service we package up something like a tin of beans to produce a late to be unfrozen unconnected reconnected into another service to become an asset or whatever for that service to become the service of delivering a meal so about the boundaries between services are where we say they are and the products connect between the boundaries so when if we look at a product one of the things we can look at is what is it that would unfreeze that product into becoming part of another service a product on its own is just a thing it's only useful and relevant when it is used in some kind of service so rather than the idea that service oriented architecture is dead it's actually the core of everything that we do everything is a service everything is represents we uses or becomes a service so service becomes the core idea that really simplifies an architecture because it works the same way everywhere every context every level services are actually the future of the past
