# Analysis: Enterprise architecture and coronavirus: Fact: Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video discusses challenges in enterprise architecture amid the coronavirus crisis, emphasizing decision-making with incomplete and uncertain information. It urges enterprise architects to support emotional resilience, accept incompetence in unknowns, and use tools like SCAN to map uncertainties and enable "good enough" decisions under deep uncertainty.[3]

## Key Takeaways
- Businesses traditionally demand absolute certainty, but coronavirus highlights incomplete facts, outdated policies, and unknown risks like transmission modes.[3]
- Emotional challenges arise when leaders face high-stakes decisions without full information; guilt is unhelpful, and support is essential, as exemplified by the Walmart CEO's response to Hurricane Katrina.[3]
- The most dangerous incompetence is overconfidence in unknowns; enterprise architects must embrace "non-competence," learn on the fly, and prepare vision, principles, and guidelines for real-time decisions.[3]
- Tools like SCAN help map uncertainties, time pressures, and risks to reduce unknowns before critical points.[3]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Admit incomplete information**: Acknowledge gaps honestly and avoid pretending to have all facts; base decisions on available data while noting limitations.[3]
- **Provide emotional and principled support**: Develop visions, guidelines, and emotional backing (e.g., "do the best you can with the information you have, and the company will support you") to empower decisions above typical authority levels.[3]
- **Use SCAN tool**: Map uncertainties, assess time available to reduce them, identify knowable vs. unknowable risks, and prepare for "hit point" where action is unavoidable; enterprise architects should ensure these are in place.[3]
- **Foster learning in uncertainty**: Encourage teams to accept non-competence, proceed anyway, and iteratively improve decision-making processes during crises.[3]
