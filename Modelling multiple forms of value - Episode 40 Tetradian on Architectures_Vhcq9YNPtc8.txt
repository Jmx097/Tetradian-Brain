Eric Weinstein asks how we model multiple forms of value for example most organizations will track the money but actually there are many other forms of value that we may need to track and depending on the type of profit that the organisation is after the type of value we really need to track may not be money at all so for example when we go back to episode 28 where we talked about every organization is for profit what are the values that feed into that profit what are the forms of value that we need to track especially when the money is secondary to the drivers for the organization now why this is important even for commercial organizations is that things like trust are actually central to the way that every organization operates however working with a bank ones that are managed to take itself from the most respected in the region to the least respected in just six months because they've managed to completely screw up the way they did trust and we had to build a whole architecture of trust around how it operated the same is true of an organization that for example might want to do self self firm self insurance for cars or for trucks there's a one I know of one large organization which does this but that again depends on trust on building and maintaining trust and proving that trust so that what we do is we go back to the enterprise story what are this what story are we in this is the enterprise that the organization operates within for example take that classic example I've used a few times of Ted that ideas worth spreading everything's about the values implied in ideas and that the I these ideas are worth spreading the money is secondary to that driver it needs to be there but it's not the purpose of the organization so we need to think clear about one of the values that we need to track and how we do them so we identify what the trap the values are that we need to track and then we model the flows and the transforms so that for example a conventional money based organization transfers every form of value into money and ignores everything else this is not a good idea so we can use models such as enterprise canvas to track what the value flows are how they move through the organization and then make sure that the values that we need so we need ways to monitor we need to measure at each step what the values are what the the effective value of that value is at each point in the transform and then look at how it transforms one value into another the key to implementation of this and what we call the pervasive services in enterprise canvas if you think of key values such as health and safety security reliability environmental effectiveness financial probity all of these are absolutely critical to the way the organization operates and we need to track them the way we do that is with services like health and safety like security who build awareness this this value is important build capability to actually enact that value at runtime make sure that it is enacted at runtime and then monitor what the effects are what the outcomes are from working on that particular value so we track it we track each value through pervasive services through monitoring and deliberate monitoring which means we need an architecture to do that monitoring to define what the monitoring will be and it applies to every organization not just a so called commercial for-profit organization because every organization is for-profit in a number of different ways and we need to track what those ways are
