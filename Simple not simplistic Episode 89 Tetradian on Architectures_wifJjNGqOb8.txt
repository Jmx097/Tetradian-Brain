one of the perennial problems in enterprise architecture and many other disciplines is a crucial distinction between simple versus simplistic the reality is that when we're dealing with the real world there is always deep complexity and yet people want to treat it as being simple which it isn't if we try to use something that is in that is not simple in a simple way it's going to not work or we're going to get caught out with really bad problems the problem is that a lot of people really are not comfortable with complexity or with any kind of abstract thinking they just want to get the job done so innovators and early adopters are usually comfortable with complexity and uncertainty the early majority the late majority really are not as I said they just want to get things done so we need to hide of the complexity but yet still leave the hooks there so that we can get to the complexity when we actually need to do so we need to make it simple but not simplistic making it dumbed down makes it actually more dangerous gives the illusion of control there's something that is quite different this is one of the reasons I get quite cross sometimes about the big consultancies and a lot of the vendors because they dumb down the complexity or pretend that it isn't there because it scares people and yet if we don't have the ability to handle the complexity again it's going to break so a real practical worked example we did a lot of work on trying to find a method that would work the same way everywhere every context every content every scope every scale every stage of implementation it had to work the same way because the complexity is drown us otherwise we need to have things driven from a simple frame we build complexity from simple base we also needed to link all the tools together across all of that space we needed to explain what the dependencies were and understand them we needed to have it all there but to a large extent hide it we needed to handle the massive amounts of branching if you think of a typical or a large project model those massive amounts of branching their massive fractality of tasks within tasks within tasks how do we keep that looking simple and working in a simple way without drowning in the actual complexity there are vast numbers of signals that go around that deal with the dependencies how do we work those so one of our focus points was how to making this work how to have something that worked the same way everywhere and yet could handle all of the complexity how do we make it simple without being simplistic that's the challenge that we needed to look at now we'll look at the detail of how we did it in the next video but for now the focus is this one challenge how do we make something that is naturally complex seem simple without dumbing it down to the point where it becomes so simplistic as to be unusable thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
