# Analysis: Introduction to SCAN complexity-map - Tetradian on Tools For Change

## Executive Summary

SCAN is a visual framework that maps complexity and uncertainty across two dimensions—certainty versus inherent unpredictability, and planning time versus real-time action—to help organizations understand their context and determine appropriate response strategies[1]. The tool categorizes situations into four domains (Simple, Complicated, Ambiguous, and Not Known) to enable more effective decision-making based on the nature of the challenge being faced.

## Key Takeaways

- **Two-Axis Framework**: SCAN operates on two intersecting axes: one ranging from certainty (predictable outcomes) to inherent uncertainty (unpredictable results), and another from planning time to immediate action requirements[1]

- **Certainty Threshold**: There exists an "effective certainty" transition point where you know enough about what's happening to act confidently; beyond this point, outcomes become unpredictable[1]

- **Four Domain Categories**: Situations are classified as Simple (certain, time to plan), Complicated (certain but complex, time to plan), Ambiguous (uncertain, some time to plan), or Not Known (uncertain, no time to plan)[1]

- **Different Responses Required**: Each domain demands different approaches—Simple domains use rules and step-by-step processes, Complicated domains require planning and expertise, while Ambiguous and Not Known domains demand adaptive, skill-based responses[1]

- **Actionable Boundaries**: The framework identifies two critical boundaries that shift based on context: the edge between effective certainty and uncertainty, and the edge between planning and action[1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials

SCAN serves as a diagnostic tool for determining how to approach a problem:

1. **Assess Your Context**: Locate your situation on the certainty axis (do you know what will happen if you repeat the same action?) and the time axis (how long until you must act?)

2. **Identify the Domain**: Determine which quadrant your challenge falls into based on these two dimensions

3. **Apply Appropriate Strategy**: 
   - *Simple*: Follow established rules and procedures
   - *Complicated*: Invest time in planning and analysis; leverage expertise
   - *Ambiguous*: Plan while experimenting; use skill to navigate uncertainty
   - *Not Known*: Act quickly and adapt in real-time based on feedback

4. **Monitor Boundary Movement**: Recognize that the transition points between domains shift as conditions change, requiring periodic reassessment

## Quotes

- "SCAN is a really simple way of making sense of complexity and then deciding what to do with it"[1]

- "There's going to be an axis a transition point between where we have effective certainty where you know enough about what's going on to where we really don't"[1]

- "On this side we're following rules things are step-by-step whereas here we're going to need skill"[1]

- "The edge of action" refers to the boundary between situations where you have time to plan and situations where you must act immediately[1]
