in the previous episode I talked a bit about rethinking projects and using a simple framework called five elements to help guide the way we do this because it connects works the same way everywhere we can also use this as a backdrop to help explain and describe some of the really common anti patterns or ways to fail when doing projects the first one is to rush straight into action in other words rush straight into process without a plan without purpose without anything this doesn't work well because if we do anything manage to do anything at all it won't be on purpose the next one not quite so bad is to rush straight into a plan rush into preparation again we may be producing something that actually is according to some kind of plan but it isn't necessarily on any kind of purpose and the danger is that the plan itself becomes the purpose to quote Stafford beers phrase what equals posy wit when you don't have a proper purpose then the purpose of the system is or whatever it does which is usually not a good idea another common one is to use the past as the future we start from performance and then try to run the whole thing backwards what happens there is that for example is the classic of strategies last year plus 10% we assume everything's going to be the same except for the bits that we want to change this is really a good idea because it's completely incapable of dealing with any actual change another very common one is to get stuck in just one place for purpose we have the idea hamsters who never get started on anything they're just constantly churning out a new idea in the people area we have endless politics we have office politics we have no one ever gets anything started it starts with blame nothing actually gets going in the preparation area we have the dreaded analysis paralysis well we churn things out do we never we churn up plans out but never actually get started we've got the one which we know about which is produce produce produce produce when we're just producing without a real plan and without a real purpose but we're producing because we can produce and then finally we get stuck in performance looking backwards at the past which again often ends up as a mess of blame you should have none of these work well we can see that by looking at it in terms of their positioning or five elements another one about this is that we can now understand more easily why waterfall gets stuck because it goes rigidly from sometimes from purpose a lot from people to fine project scopes it then goes into preparation it then goes into production and only then does it learn oh if that's happening over a period of two years you're making a commitment to never learn anything and not change anything for the whole of that time this tends to be not a good idea and the other one which is also very dangerous and the unfortunate is particularly popular now is the debt the downside of the agile loop because again we start with halfway through preparation we rush into process to make something happen we get halfway through learning and we loop back we don't have any architecture or any big picture view so we have no idea what we're doing we guess the purpose is going to come out of what we do on the fly so this doesn't work terribly well either so what we're doing with five elements what five elements shows us is actually the only pattern that actually works which is going from Y to who to help - what and then learn continuously iteratively recursively fractally looping within itself so that we're learning continuously all the time but we keep largely to the core of the purpose with which we started this is actually the only way that works every other approach that we can map out on here it tends to be an anti-pattern that leads towards failure you
