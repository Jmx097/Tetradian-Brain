# Analysis: Introduction to Five Elements method - Tetradian on Tools For Change

## Executive Summary

The Five Elements method (also called CSPAR: Context, Scope, Plan, Action, Review) is **a consistent framework for guiding change across any level of complexity, scope, or scale**[4]. The method uses a cyclical process that ensures teams address the right questions before executing solutions, incorporates multiple perspectives, and builds in continuous review and improvement.

## Key Takeaways

- **The Five Elements cycle consists of five phases**: Context (understanding purpose and success criteria), Scope (identifying stakeholders and skills needed), Plan (preparation and guidance), Action (execution without stopping to think), and Review (checking against original success criteria)[4]

- **Team roles are essential to success**: A Pathfinder/Guide keeps the team on track and ensures they're doing the right things; a Recorder/Scribe captures insights and information during active exploration; a Coordinator links multiple teams; and a Vision/Enterprise Story provides overarching values and guidance[4]

- **Asking the right question comes before executing the answer**: The method prioritizes determining "Are we doing the right things?" (Context and Scope phases) before moving to "Are we doing things right?" (Plan, Action, and Review phases)[4]

- **Diversity of perspectives is critical**: Teams should include people with different viewpoints to maximize the possibility of finding appropriate ideas, information, and insights[4]

- **The framework scales recursively**: It works identically whether applied to a single team, multiple teams across different scopes, or enterprise-wide initiatives with varying complexity levels[4]

- **Continuous review drives improvement**: After every action, an after-action review checks results against the original success criteria, enabling ongoing iteration and learning[4]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials

**Basic Five Elements Process**:

1. **Context**: Start with a clear question (e.g., "How should we use AI in our business?"). Define purpose, success criteria, and identify gaps in information or understanding that become your scopes for action.

2. **Scope**: Determine who the stakeholders are and what skillsets are needed. Develop project specifications based on these findings.

3. **Plan**: Conduct standard preparation activities. Establish guidance and structure before moving to action—this is essential because action itself leaves no time for deliberation.

4. **Action**: Execute with the plan in place. The Recorder captures insights and information in real time; the Guide ensures the team stays on track.

5. **Review**: Conduct an after-action review comparing results against the original success criteria. This closes the loop and enables iteration.

**For Scaling Across Multiple Teams**: Add a Coordinator role to link teams together and establish a shared Vision or Enterprise Story that provides overarching values to guide real-time decision-making[4].

## Quotes

- "The aim is it's a consistent method to guide change that we pull other tools in but it keeps a consistency across the whole"[4]

- "We need diversity we need a number of different perspectives to get the best best possibility of finding appropriate ideas information and insights"[4]

- "If we rush straight to plan from the question we're going to miss out that first really important thing about is this the right thing to be doing"[4]

- "In action when we're going to the action itself there's no time to stop and think that's why we need the plan in place"[4]

- "It's actually the same for every type of content or context the same at every scope or scale a consistent method to help us guide how change will work"[4]
