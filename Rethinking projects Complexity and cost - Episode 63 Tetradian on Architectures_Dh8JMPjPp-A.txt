for this episode I'd like to look more at the Gantt chart again and how we handle uncertainty how we handle complexity and cost because if we look take the classic uncertainty matrix no known known unknowns unknown knowns and unknown unknowns when we look at how whenever we're doing a with a something that is uncertainty a blank something that we've got to find out about particularly in explore every blank implies a new task but we've come in by definition with something that's at least partly unknown so our aim with each task is to reduce the unknowns to nomes we fill in the blank we make it less complex by doing so but beware we cannot remove all unknowns for example a simple example of a known unknown is ad in a sales process we might have all of the sets system set up but we've still got a known variable of which owner who the customer is as they come into that space so there's going to be have to be some adaptation for each different type of customer it is unknown unknown but it will never be known until the moment of action so we can measure some of this uncertainty with us in some senses if you think of the squiggle then the width of the squiggle is the amount of uncertainty that currently exists within that task so that we are reducing that but we can't reduce all of it this has a direct implication for cost because if we don't know it then we also don't know its costs so the uncertainty of the cut of the task itself implies an uncertainty of the cost then what we've reduce then the unknown knowns to the known then what we can reduce to the known the more we can make the cost know or within we can know the boundaries of those variables of cost but we also need to think in again in turn not just into cost in terms of money but cost in terms of time cost in terms of resources cost in terms of how long it takes to get a skill together cost in terms of reputation there are many costs involved here and what we do in each task is map out what the uncertainties are in order to tell us what the uncertainties are cost us if we expect to have a fixed cost for something that is inherently uncertain we're going to be disappointed
