this time it's a question from Zara al-haj who asked about the relationship between enterprise architecture innovation and design thinking well straight away we've got a bit of a problem here because Design Thinking is a very blurry and much misused term but the way I suggest is for different things one of them first of all it's about inherent uncertainty we don't know what's going to happen and where the first stages of any project are very uncertain a blurry that's what's known as the squiggle which by Damian Neumann who described it being like this it's a wild chaotic mess and going backwards and forwards and it kind of all over the place pattern at the beginning we slowly settle out towards something descriptive and clear and that which we can finally implement so this managing this relationship between the messy and the production end secondly it kind of operates in a kind of ambiguous and not on the verses not known pairing in terms of scan first feet where we are planning something out we dive down into the uncertain into the deeply uncertain and bounce back just touching into the into the real world and then back again into thinking things through as we get closer towards the production part we've got to move more over to having a definite plan and then into the simple step by step type instructions but we then have this hopping backwards and forwards between simple and the not known at the production level we can also think of it in terms of iteration thinking of the squiggle not so much just as a one shot but added it added us right now and then we're done but actually it's this kind of chaotic thing we get towards something that is done and then we loop round back to the beginning again so this process of finding it through an iterative process that drops us back into the chaos and we need to expect that rather than assume it's not going to happen that once we've got towards a certain idea it's done no we're not we're going to loop round back again and the other thing that comes out of Design Thinking is a real focus not on finding the answer the solution or even worse here's a solution of what can I force something to fit to it but instead where the focus is on finding the right question because when we find the right way to frame what the real question is it seems like the answer that we need kind of falls out on its own quite naturally so the integration of all of this between the blurry design thinking that the intentionally blurry design thinking the innovation process of dipping into the uncertain of the unknown and Enterprise Architecture driving it much more towards execution and implementation well one way to look at the integration of this is TOGAF done right when chogath assumes that the world is only about IT infrastructure and everything else has been rather plunged on to it but if we remove the assumption about that it's only about RIT it's actually quite a good method for following design thinking processes we have the initial expectation the expiration phase the the Inc the how are we going to implement a phase the actual implementation and the learning looping round back to the beginning so that we can do a full loop so Tonkov does work that way if that's what you want to use but you can't use it assuming that it's only about RT the problem there are really real problems in togas faces BC and D around that but the other one is to realize that it's a it's a skill it's definitely a skill it's not something which you can just get out of a book you can only do it by practice and practice means getting it wrong quite a bit of the time so we have to make it safe to fail that's why people often talk about fail to learn but importantly remembering the comma there fail comma to learn but it's a skill it's not a step-by-step method but we integrate them somewhat as TOGAF does with iteration with working with the uncertainty with when from looking for the right question the right way to frame the question that we need in order to have the answer that we need fall out almost on attack
