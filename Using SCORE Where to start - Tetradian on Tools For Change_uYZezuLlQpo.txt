in a previous video we looked at what score is how it works what it's for about strategy about making sense of things rather like SWOT but in much more useful way so we've got it scrawled out as if on a whiteboard or notepad and how do we use it that's what we'll focus on in this one where do we start that's the focus here so we have strengths which are capabilities we've got challenges or the issues that we've got internal to our organization we've got the options which are opportunities risks and other things that happen outside that we can see and responses which is the real world coming back to us with either responses raging x' rewards whatever and linking them all together we have effectiveness but why do we start well we start always with some kind of comment or question what's the issue that we're dealing with like for example one will still use in another video is we've installed 3d printing how can we make best use of this so what we're looking for in the the phrase that we start with such as 3d printing what we're looking for in that phrase is cues so if we're just saying how do we use it we might be looking at it in terms of the opportunity that it represents how do we use it might be we have no idea how to use it so it becomes a challenge we're looking for is we've been told we have to use this the external world tells us the market is doing this or would we use it we would start there from response so if it's a capability about something that we now have a new strength that we have available to us we'd start from a strength if it's a question about how on earth are we going to use it so this is we try this as capabilities [Music] over here we'd start we'd start with challenges if we see this as something that we need to use we don't know how to do we'd see it as an options opportunity or risk which are right there and remember that we always see them as a as a pair we always work on them as a pair we often see them as outside to ourself this is the real world talking at us so we choose to start there if hey there's an opportunity here about 3d printing hey there's a as a risk that we might have about being left out here it's about this is the real world responding so we'd start here if it's something that's coming fry at us from the real world we haven't looked for it that would be an option this is the real world telling us and in effectiveness it's the crucial word here is quality what is it that works what is it that guides us to help making things work that's where our effectiveness comes from if we're on track to effectiveness we will get the best quality in every sense of that word so security safety financial probity all of these things that are improving the quality of the work so we start in school from wherever we choose we can start anywhere but pick up from the cues of the clues of the statement itself is it about things that we now have that we could possibly use is it things that we don't know how to use that we've seemed to be needing to use is this about the options that we have the opportunities or risks that the real world is we can see in the real world is it the real world telling us or is it something that will help us improve the quality improve our promise to the enterprise these are the places we could start with school thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
