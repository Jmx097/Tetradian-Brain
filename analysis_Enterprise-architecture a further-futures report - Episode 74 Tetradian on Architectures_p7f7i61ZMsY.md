# Analysis: Enterprise-architecture: a further-futures report - Episode 74, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video presents a visionary status report on enterprise architecture (EA), urging a shift from IoT-centric, IT-focused models to a generalized, human-oriented toolkit for purposeful integration and change across global scales. It emphasizes moving beyond rigid frameworks like TOGAF to holistic, sustainable architectures addressing survival challenges, politics, and interweaving human and technological elements. The core message is that EA must evolve into decision-support for planetary-scale "survival architectures" within a decade.

## Key Takeaways
- Generalize EA as a **toolkit for change**, focusing on connection, purpose, alignment, and "getting things to dance" rather than rigid layers or IT-only concerns.
- Shift from TOGAF's "idiocy" of business-data-applications-technology stacks to **layers of abstraction and content**, covering human issues, non-IT tech, and their interweave, from big-picture intentions to implementation and continuous learning.
- Extend EA to **global scope and scale**, rethinking economics from short-term "want it now" to sustainability and survival, including jobs, work, politics, and planetary "survival architectures."
- Recognize EA as **decision support, not decision-making**, while navigating the "relentlessly political" challenges of making connections even in small organizations.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Break out of IoT-centric boxes**: Prioritize human-oriented approaches in EA design to unlock full potential.
- **Adopt purposeful integration**: Use EA to enable services, relations, and alignment across entire contexts, treating it as a generic toolkit rather than siloed functions.
- **Rethink architectural layers**: Move from functional stacks (e.g., TOGAF) to abstraction/content layers, mapping big-picture intentions, connections, implementation, operation, and learning loops.
- **Scale to global survival**: Build "survival architectures" at planetary levels, starting with political navigation practice in small organizations to handle larger scopes.
- **Support decisions politically**: Position architects as enablers for decision-makers, emphasizing practice in cross-organizational connections.

## Quotes
- "things work better when they work together **on purpose** we're talking about connection about purpose about alignment about getting things to dance"
- "we don't get hung up any more about the **idiocy's of the bean app framework** of business data applications technology"
- "a fundamental shift from the **carand economics** of we want it now... to about **sustainability** and frankly... **survival**"
- "survival **Arkansas** survival architectures and service architectures for an enterprise where the enterprise is the **whole of the planet** right up to a truly literally **global scale**"
- "making connections even across a small organization is **relentlessly political**"
