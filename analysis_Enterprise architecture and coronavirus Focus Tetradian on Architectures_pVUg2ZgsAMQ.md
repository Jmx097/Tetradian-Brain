# Analysis: Enterprise architecture and coronavirus: Focus: Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
In times of disruption like the coronavirus pandemic, enterprise architecture provides stability through focused anchors such as vision, values, and principles, preventing panic and scope creep. The speaker advocates using these elements—exemplified by TED's "ideas worth spreading"—alongside a service-oriented mindset to maintain direction and support the broader enterprise story.[7]

## Key Takeaways
- Disruptive events like pandemics cause overload and panic, especially in stable organizations; a "sheet anchor" like vision offers flexible stability rather than rigidity.[7]
- Focus on **vision, values, and principles** (e.g., TED's "ideas worth spreading") to test activities against the core business story, avoiding scope creep and assessing worth in chaos.[7]
- A true vision is outward-looking from the enterprise's story, not inward marketing puffery like "be the biggest provider."[7]
- If vision is unclear, emphasize **service**: identify who you serve, how, mutual responsibilities, checks/balances, and adaptations like buffers for supply-chain disruptions.[7]
- Service mindset ensures symmetrical interactions, supporting the whole enterprise ecosystem to prevent collective failure.[7]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Test against vision/values/principles**: In chaos, ask: "What is everyone working on relative to the big story? Is it worthwhile? What is the measure of success?" Use as a daily anchor (e.g., for a baker: focus on high-quality, gluten-free bread worth eating).[7]
- **Assess service quality**: Define good vs. bad service, mutual responsibilities, and on-the-fly fixes (e.g., add buffers/warehouses to just-in-time supply chains when disruptions hit).[7]
- **Symmetrical service checks**: Shift from one-sided terms/conditions to balanced interactions; support struggling enterprise partners to avoid ripple effects.[7]
