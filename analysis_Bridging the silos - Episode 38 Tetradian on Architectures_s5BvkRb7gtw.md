# Analysis: Bridging the silos - Episode 38, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video discusses using Enterprise Architecture to bridge organizational silos rather than breaking them, emphasizing that silos form naturally from differing jargon, perspectives, and histories. It advocates for purposeful connections through tools like VPEC-T and building trust via in-person relationships to enhance collaboration without disrupting specialized groups.

## Key Takeaways
- Silos arise naturally from each discipline's unique jargon, perspectives, histories, and views, and attempting to break them risks damaging the organization.
- Enterprise Architecture should focus on **bridging silos** by connecting dots across clinical and business areas that groups might not see independently.
- Use the **VPEC-T framework** (Values, Policies, Events, Content, Trust) to map potential clashes between groups and identify bridging strategies.
- The enterprise architect's role is inherently political, requiring time to build trust and social networks through in-person relations rather than imposing solutions.
- Core principle: "Things work better when they work together **on purpose**," prioritizing effective, intentional connections over forced integration.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Apply the **VPEC-T tool** to map clashes: Analyze **Values**, **Policies**, **Events**, **Content**, and **Trust** between silos, then develop targeted bridges group-to-group before scaling enterprise-wide.
- Build trust as an architect by investing in **in-person relationships** and social networks—avoid imposing architectures, as this erodes trust and hinders political navigation.
- Start small: Connect specific clinical and business areas incrementally, using architecture to reveal hidden interconnections.

## Quotes
- "Things work better when they work together **on purpose**."
- "We must **bridge the silos not attempt to break them**... if we try to break them we'll actually break the organization."
- "The role of an Enterprise Architect depends on **trust**... our work at the enterprise architecture level is very **political** it has to be very **in person**."
