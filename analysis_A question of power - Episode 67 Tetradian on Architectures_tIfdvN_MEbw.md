# Analysis: A question of power - Episode 67, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video explores power dynamics in enterprise architecture, introducing the **Semper model** as a framework to address political challenges by shifting from dysfunctional avoidance of work to collective responsibility. It contrasts physics-based power (ability to do work) with social misconceptions (avoiding work), advocating for **"power-with"** and **"everyone wins"** approaches to ensure effective work completion.

## Key Takeaways
- Enterprise architecture is **relentlessly political**, always involving people and power issues, making models like Semper essential for navigation.
- Power's true physics definition is the **ability to do work**, but social views often twist it into avoiding work or entrapping others, leading to dysfunction and no progress.
- The **Semper scale** ranges from **actively dysfunctional** (power-over: competition where everyone loses) to **holding responsibility** (everyone committed to necessary work).
- Ultimate power source is **internal** ("inner fire"), best realized through **power-with** (mutual support) rather than command-and-control or pigeonholing (e.g., Taylorism).
- Dysfunctional stages include **power-under** (avoiding responsibility, blame-shifting) and **power-over** (putting others down), both resulting in lose-lose outcomes.
- Viable power dynamic: **everyone wins** or everyone loses—architecture must value work to achieve the former.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Use the **Semper model** to diagnose power issues: assess teams on the scale from dysfunctional avoidance (power-under/over) to responsible collaboration (power-with).
- In enterprise architecture, prioritize **internal power development** ("maintain that inner fire") and foster **power-with** relationships to maximize collective work efficiency.
- Avoid **win-lose transactional models**; reframe politics toward valuing all contributions to ensure work gets done effectively.

## Quotes
- "Enterprise Architecture is described well as **relentlessly political** were always dealing with people and we're always dealing with power issues."
- "The physics definition of power is the **ability to do work** but far too many social definitions of power are the **ability to avoid work**."
- "The ultimate source of power is actually only **from within the self** it's like a live like an **inner fire**."
- "The usual relationship to power which is the idea of **win or lose**... it's actually an **illusory form of lose-lose**."
- "The real question of power that we need to address in enterprise architecture [is] about making sure that the **ability to do work and the valuing of that work occurs** because otherwise **everyone loses**."
