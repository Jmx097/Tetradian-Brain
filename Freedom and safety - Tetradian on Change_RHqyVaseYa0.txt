a useful starting point for ideas comes from a comment by bad papa guy where he says that freedom and safety are not compatible you can't be free and safe at the same time now this often arises in things like innovation by definition we can't be safe when we have the freedom to change something because safety is about what we already know there's an emotional or conceptual safety in doing what we already know but any change requires us to let go of safety for a while a kind of safety at least in order to have the freedom to support change so explore that a bit where do you depend on safety where does your feeling of safety come from how much do you depend on what you know and therefore when you are faced with the world changing around you how much do you hold on to something that is actually less safe because you're not allowing the freedom to happen you can be both unfree and unsafe very easily but you can't have both freedom and safety at the same time they both require a certain amount of give and take so where is your safety your point of safety where's a reference point that you hold on to what happens when the world changes around you where do you find the freedom to let go of elements at least of that safety in order to be free how do you constrain both usefully and not usefully your freedom your safe your freedom in order to protect safety for example with an enterprise we often choose an anchor point a belief a structure a set of values which allows us to the the freedom around that space to be able to adapt this is absolutely core to things like enterprise architectures where we need an anchor when we're dealing with huge amounts of change we need some kind of anchor to hold the edges that we need to some kind of edge that we can identify something around so what freedom do we choose what safety do we choose in order to enable things to change or enable our own response to change as well
