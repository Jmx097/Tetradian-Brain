# Analysis: Making an EA method: Episode 91, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video outlines the iterative development of a simple, fractal enterprise architecture (EA) method to manage immense complexity across step-by-step sequences, parallel processes, deepening details, and random insights. It evolves from initial metaphors like rooms around an atrium and information folders to a consistent pattern of **mission** (identify issue), **context/scope**, repeated **plan-action-review** cycles, and final whole-review. This approach embraces complexity via hooks without over-simplifying, drawing from models like Tuckman and Chinese Five Elements for fractality at any scale.[1][2][5]

## Key Takeaways
- EA method complexity arises from clashing dimensions: **step-by-step sequences**, **parallel tracks**, **nested details**, bidirectional links causing redesigns, information storage needs, and random insights.[1][5]
- Early models (e.g., purpose-people-preparation-process-performance rotating around a pivot, or rooms/atrium metaphor) humanized the process but failed to handle parallels and details effectively.[1][2]
- Final method uses a **content-neutral, fractal pattern**: start with a mission/question, define big-picture/context/scope/boundaries/participants, apply repeatable plan-action-review cycles (as checklists), end with overall review and answer delivery.[1][5]
- Emphasizes **simplicity amid complexity** by keeping the core pattern consistent across scopes/scales, avoiding loops or fixed sequences, and including hooks for all complexity types without embedding them.[2][5]
- Supports **start-anywhere** principle, applicable to any content/context, with recursive nesting for depth.[1][2]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
The video describes an evolutionary process to the final EA method, presented as a repeatable, fractal structure. Here's the synthesized step-by-step approach from the transcript and aligned sources:

1. **Start a Mission**: Identify the core issue/question, who is involved, why it matters, and the expected outcome/answer.[1][5]
2. **Big Picture & Boundaries**: Map context, scope, participants, and choices/constraints (e.g., use checklists for vision/values).[1][5]
3. **Preparation/Plan**: For each task/folder, define the plan, including time-horizons (current/future states) and "just enough detail" conditions.[1][5]
4. **Process/Action**: Execute the task, capturing what is done; store information accessibly (e.g., folders).[5]
5. **Performance/Review**: Assess what was achieved, lessons learned, alignment to purpose; use After Action Review (AAR): what was supposed to happen vs. what actually happened.[1][5]
6. **Iterate Fractally**: Repeat plan-action-review in parallel/nested cycles as needed; handle links/insights by revisiting prior steps; end with full review for the mission's answer.[1][2][5]
- **Tips**: Always complete the full cycle (don't skip phases); attach content/frameworks consciously per iteration; use for any scale/depth, starting anywhere.[2][5]

## Quotes
- "The challenge that we faced when trying to build an EI method that would cover the full scope and scale was to find a way to simplify the very real complexity that covers the whole of that space."
- "We've accepted that we can't actually include all of the complexity but by focusing on the pattern and keeping the pattern consistent every time we end up with something that is still absolutely consistent every scope every scale type of content any type of context."
- "What's the issue let's start a mission within this we have any number of what's the context what's the scope enormous numbers of plan action review plan action review... with an ending to do the review of the whole and returning the answer that we need."[1][5]
