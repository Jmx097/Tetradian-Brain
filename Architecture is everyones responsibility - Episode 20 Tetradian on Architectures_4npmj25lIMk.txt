a theme I'd like to introduce today is the idea that architecture is everyone's responsibility as I've said before in a previous episode architecture really comes down to a very simple idea which is that things work better when they work together on purpose but that applies everywhere to everything which internally effectively makes it necessarily everyone's responsibility to make sure that things work together better and on purpose so it's a pervasive theme much like themes like such as health and safety security ethics environment financial probity and so on all of which are by definition everyone's responsibility in which case if it's everyone's responsibility it's quite reasonable to us what do architects do short answer is that an architect provides a service as a guide a mentor and an in-depth specialist though the role is to help other people take on that responsibility so it's providing in-person support for architecture practices it's about building awareness of the capability to do things the bility to enact and also the ability to review and improve because if we want things to get better we've got to be able to learn from what we've done and continually improve also architects there's some specialist skills involved in maintaining an enterprise repository a repository of master information about architecture about the big picture that connects everything together and then everything must intersect with supporting strategy in that sense it's that the continual support for strategy so what architecture is everyone's responsibility Architects are there to support it but equally it's not the responsibility of the architects alone architectures everyone's responsibility
