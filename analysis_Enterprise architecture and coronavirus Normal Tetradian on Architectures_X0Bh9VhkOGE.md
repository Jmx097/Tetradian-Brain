# Analysis: Enterprise architecture and coronavirus: Normal: Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary

The video challenges the common phrase "getting back to normal" during the coronavirus crisis, arguing that "normal" is often an illusion based on habit and avoidance rather than reality[1]. Instead, organizations should embrace dynamic adaptation guided by clear vision and principles, recognizing that in a rapidly changing environment, a fixed "normal" will always be outdated[1].

## Key Takeaways

- **"Normal" is subjective and problematic**: What feels comfortable and normal to some is deeply uncomfortable for others, raising the question of whether returning to the old normal is actually desirable[1]
- **Normal as geometric concept**: In geometry, "normal" means perpendicular (90 degrees); much of what society calls "normal" is actually sideways from reality with no real connection[1]
- **Normal masks avoidance**: Clinging to the idea of normal often prevents people from facing present realities and necessary actions; it's fundamentally about habit and wishful thinking[1]
- **Uncertainty is inherent**: In high-level change, the only certainty is that we don't know how things will unfold; clinging to beliefs prevents sensing actual conditions[1]
- **Dynamic rather than static**: True "normal" in changing environments must be dynamic—a continuous state of adaptation rather than a fixed destination[1]
- **Vision and principles guide adaptation**: Organizations need clear vision, values (tests for evaluation), and principles (identifiers of direction) to guide continuous adaptation toward desired futures[1]
- **Maslow's hierarchy applies**: Comfort and normality should include foundational needs (food, relationships, peace) plus higher-order needs (meaning, purpose, sense of belonging)[1]
- **Continuous transformation**: Organizations should operate in perpetual cycles—acknowledging current state, moving to the next iteration, testing, and repeating—rather than seeking fixed endpoints[1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials

**For Organizations and Individuals:**

1. **Define your vision of normal**: Rather than returning to the past, articulate what a desirable future state actually looks like in concrete terms[1]

2. **Identify success signals**: Determine specific indicators that will tell you when you've reached your version of "normal" so you can recognize progress[1]

3. **Establish guiding values and principles**: Create frameworks for decision-making that tell you whether you're moving toward or away from your desired state[1]

4. **Audit current practices**: Examine what aspects of the old "normal" actually work and which create problems; be honest about trade-offs (e.g., remote work benefits versus isolation costs)[1]

5. **Implement continuous adaptation cycles**: Adopt an iterative approach—acknowledge the current state, move incrementally toward the next version, test results, and repeat indefinitely[1]

6. **Design flexible architectures**: Build systems, processes, and structures that support ongoing transformation rather than enforcing fixed states[1]
