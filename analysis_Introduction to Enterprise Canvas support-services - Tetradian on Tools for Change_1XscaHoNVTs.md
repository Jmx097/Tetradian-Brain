# Analysis: Introduction to Enterprise Canvas support-services - Tetradian on Tools for Change

## Executive Summary
This video explains the support services essential for the viability of any core service within the Enterprise Canvas framework, building on the previous video's core service model. It categorizes these into **direction services**, **coordination services**, **validation services** for quality, and services for **investors and beneficiaries**, all derived from the Viable System Model (VSM). The key message is that these support services act as a checklist to ensure service success, emphasizing support over control.[1]

## Key Takeaways
- Enterprise Canvas extends the core service model (before/during/after interactions) with support services across three timescales: **strategy**, **tactics**, and **operations**.[1]
- **Direction services** provide guidance at strategic (identity/purpose), tactical (future/outside focus), and operational (runtime/inside focus) levels, akin to management layers from VSM.[1]
- **Coordination services** include runtime coordination (external interactions), change coordination (e.g., project management office linking operations-tactics), and strategic coordination (e.g., portfolio management or enterprise architecture linking strategy-tactics).[1]
- **Validation services** manage quality concerns (e.g., security, safety, ethics) via building awareness (before), capability (during runtime), and continuous review/improvement (after), often using standards.[1]
- Services for **investors** (e.g., company or family providing resources oppositely to suppliers) and **beneficiaries** (receiving value oppositely to customers) connect to value governance for balance, preventing organizational failure.[1]
- All support services are fractal and essential for viability; their absence leads to service failure, and they interrelate with the core service without controlling it.[1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Use Enterprise Canvas as a **visual checklist** for any service: map core elements (suppliers, internals, customers with before/during/after), then overlay support services (direction, coordination, validation, investors/beneficiaries) to assess viability.[1]
- For each support category, break into three timescales/connections:
  1. Identify strategic/tactical/operational direction needs and assign guidance (e.g., line management for operations).[1]
  2. Map coordination: runtime (interactions), change (PMO), strategic (portfolio/EA).[1]
  3. List quality concerns (e.g., security, sustainability); implement via awareness-building (posters/engagement), runtime capability (training/actions), and after-action reviews against standards.[1]
- Balance investor/beneficiary flows with value governance to avoid failures like favoring financial investors over community ones.[1]
- Reference Viable System Model (VSM) for deeper structure; check YouTube description for links.[1]
- Apply fractally: every sub-service within a service requires these supports.[1]

## Quotes
- "This provides a **viability checklist** for any service if these aren't here then that service will fail."[1]
- "They are **support services not control services** this is a fundamental issue that a lot of people think management is it about control well it's just another support service."[1]
- "Every given service must have these support services in order for that service to be **viable** it needs direction it needs coordination it needs validation."[1]
- "Investors are not necessarily monetary for example if you're working for a company then the company is an investor in your family otherwise you're not going to be available for the company to work in the company."[1]
