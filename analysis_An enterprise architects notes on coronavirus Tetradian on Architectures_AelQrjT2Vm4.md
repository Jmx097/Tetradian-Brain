# Analysis: An enterprise architect's notes on coronavirus: Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The speaker, an enterprise architect at Heathrow Airport, shares real-time personal disruptions from a mandatory 14-day quarantine policy amid the coronavirus outbreak, using it as a lens to critique poorly designed systems and architectures that fail under chaos. He highlights how new technologies enable contactless work like video recording, while emphasizing the need for better architectural design to handle impossible requirements. This serves as a wake-up call for enterprise architectures, with a note that he may be offline due to travel and health risks.

## Key Takeaways
- Personal plans (hotel stays, travel, campervan rental) are disrupted by quarantine rules lacking practical implementation guidance, exposing structural flaws in policy and systems.
- Architectures and systems often poorly anticipate real-world chaos, expecting individuals to resolve inherent design errors or "slips through the cracks."
- New technologies, such as solo video recording and publishing, enable communication and work without physical contact, providing resilience in uncertain times.
- This situation acts as a "useful wake-up call" for rethinking four key points in enterprise architectures to better handle uncertainty and impossible demands.
- The speaker, in a high-risk category, may be out of action for weeks, underscoring the value of prior tools and videos for ongoing usefulness.[1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Adapt to chaos with contactless tools**: Use solo video recording and direct publishing to communicate and produce content without interacting with others, bypassing quarantine restrictions.
- **Design for real-world feasibility**: When creating policies, architectures, or software, ensure they include practical means to comply—avoid "arbitrarily urgently placed" rules without support, such as quarantine instructions that suggest hotels but limit bookings to 3 days.
- **Prepare for extended offline periods**: Develop and share reusable tools, techniques, and videos in advance to support others during personal disruptions like illness or travel halts.
- Identify and address "structural errors" in systems by testing against chaos scenarios, rather than leaving fixes to end-users.

## Quotes
- "I'm having to look very much firsthand at my own choices in my own situation and things that I can do to design around the chaos."
- "Our architectures systems are very often very poorly designed and expect the people to sort out them at the structural errors and the structural problems in the arbitrarily designed piece of software or in this case an arbitrarily urgently placed policy with no means of actually following it through."
- "There's always something that slips through the cracks so these are really four points that we can think about within our architectures there are very useful wake-up call."
- "I hope the tools that we've developed over the years over the past couple of years and the videos that we've done that they're actually useful to you in the future thank you very much for all your interest in the work that I've been doing over these years."
