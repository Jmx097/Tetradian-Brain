when i look around at the issues that are affecting the world right now it seems clear that so many of them are rooted in ideology or belief or religion if you like and there's a very simple way around those which is to reframe it that religion is a private matter not a public one so that gives us a very important shift it tells us that we can't arbitrarily impose our religion on others because it's a private matter we may believe that something is to be true but that's our responsibility not someone else's as i've said in another video feelings of facts i can't control what you feel i can't do anything about to ensure that you feel or don't feel a certain way the same comes true with the beliefs i can't force you to believe i can give you practical circumstances where you discover whether a belief is useful or not for example it's generally unwise to assume that gravity doesn't exist there are some very real issues that come out around physics but the human bodies are not really well well designed to handle falling from 100 feet or more from 10 stories whereas an ant can quite happily handle it it's a matter of the physics of it the belief doesn't really come useful there even if we believe it can do otherwise and even then of course all innovation consists of changing a belief such that something else becomes possible but if we shift it to that point where private matter it breaks us out of most of these deadlocks where someone is trying to impose their religion on someone else
