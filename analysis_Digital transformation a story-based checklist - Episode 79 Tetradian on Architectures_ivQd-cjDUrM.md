# Analysis: Digital transformation: a story-based checklist - Episode 79, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video presents a simple **story-based checklist** for digital transformation, emphasizing the big-picture narrative to avoid common failures. It outlines five key steps—Why, Who, How, What, and Outcomes—that structure transformation around values, players, services, details, and continuous improvement.[1][5]

## Key Takeaways
- Transformation must start with the **story space**: map values, value flows, key players, and drivers to align the business narrative.[1]
- Identify **players** across internal workings, transactions (suppliers/partners/customers), interactions (regulations/recruitment/training), market (competitors/collaborators), and broader influences, including responsibilities.[1]
- Define **how** via a service approach: describe interactions as services and service cycles (relationship-building, contracting, work, closure).[1][2]
- Detail the **what**: service content, assets, events, resources, capabilities, and locations to enable practical implementation.[1]
- Focus on **outcomes**: establish metrics, records, and learning loops to review, improve, and reconnect to core values for ongoing refinement.[1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
The checklist provides a step-by-step framework for transformation:
1. **Why**: Map the story space—values, value flows, players (internal/external), and drivers.[1]
2. **Who**: Analyze players from inside-out—internal human/tech workings, transaction space (suppliers/partners/customers), interaction space (regulations/recruitment/training), market space (competitors/collaborators/partners), and broader story influences; define responsibilities and relationships.[1]
3. **How**: Use a service approach—describe services and cycles: bring people in, build relationships, define contracts, do the work, close relationships.[1][2]
4. **What**: Detail service content, assets, events, resources, capabilities, locations for development.[1]
5. **Outcomes**: Set up review processes—metrics, records (working backwards), emphasis on continual learning and improvement tied to values.[1]
This cycles back to values, enabling iterative enhancement; apply it as a foundational tool before detailed development.[1][7]

## Quotes
- "for the last part of this brief series on digital transformation I'd like to propose a a simple story based checklist for any kind of transformation it's real this tackles the big picture the story on which any transformation is built we really must not miss miss out this step because a lot of people do and it's often the cause of failure"[1][5]
- "so that's a very simple checklist that you can use there's like a story that talks about the structure of a story that tells you going from the values down to the real practical other gun that continuing on to make it work or in practice"[1][5]
- "WIC aim is to continually learn from each action and continually improve in relation to the story what do we need to make that happen"[1]
