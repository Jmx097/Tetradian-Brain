one thing I've really noticed s-- in this period of isolation is how much cleaner the air is and particularly now recently when I've moved to the city of Bendigo in southern Australia really noticing the remnants of the old mining space the wreckage left behind both of these are related to what I would call anti property the counterpart to what we think of as property property is mine it's mine auntie property is everyone else's it's somebody else's problem I get what I want somebody else has to deal with the consequences it's a really common attitude is actually built into a large part of our culture we have the entitlement to not deal with the mess that we create that so-called rights this is a rather interesting point now particularly when I was looking around in the mining area seeing the sheer scale of the problem and the disparity back in the 1950s through to the 1900s it was considered that a third of an ounce per tonne of quartz got gold per tonne was considered to be profitable that's the tree one thousandth of a percent so the other 99.999% becomes magically somebody else's problem now in economics we refer to this as externalities but it's actually much more much more than just external we've externalize the costs it's quite interesting to look at just how many business models actually depend on having the circled right to offload responsibility to someone else as for example I Drive my car everyone else has to deal with the pull that comes from driving my car it builds up and builds up and it doesn't go away now when you have an economics that depends all this you're ending up eventually with an economics that is going to poison itself into oblivion it's not sustainable in a finite system we cannot just simply sweep it under the carpet or magically expect nature to deal with all of it we'll be overloading the system beyond repair so we really need to look very closely at what's going on what anti property our organization is producing and how we're offloading it on to others and how much it can come back to us this is particularly important for enterprise architects and business architects because it's our business model is dependent on offloading responsibility to someone else then what happens when they stop being responsible for our art ideas what happens when they simply pass the problem back to us our business is suddenly no longer sustainable so for Enterprise architects and business architects it seems like a definitely a good idea to start exploring what anti property our organization is trying is currently developing is currently dumping on others and one of the risks when it starts coming back what happens to our business models if they cease to be sustainable what happens if the business model of the whole world proves itself to be unsustainable this is the kind of thing that's been coming up for me as I've been reflecting on the coronavirus you
