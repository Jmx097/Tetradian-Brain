for enterprise architects one thing that's worth considering about this pandemic is that it's essentially a very clear example of a kurtosis risk kurtosis risk is otherwise known as a long tail risk is a known unknown with apparently low low probability but a very high impact so that the effective gains that we make by ignoring the risk can be wiped out and often vastly more when the risk actually eventuates but the important point about a kurtosis risk is particularly around repetition then as an individual in instance the risk may be very low probability but when it's repeated and repeated and repeated the room the risk it rises quite rapidly till it becomes almost so and in business we see a number of examples of this so for example a classic example one of my favorites would be customer service when customer service is designed to essentially screw people over you end up with that's creating a risk and generally speaking used to be the idea that if someone got a monoid that's all that happened but in these days with social media you can have spectacular booby-trapped explosions what I called pass the grenade sometimes when the whole industry is doing this the example there was the video or song United breaks guitars where a singer they must have a United Airlines had messed him around for over a year but he said if I was a filmmaker I would make a film about this but I'm not a filmmaker I'm only a songwriter so I write a song about this now to save themselves about five hundred dollars you earned by avoiding paying the cost for the damage to the guitar that was broken you know the direct cost fifty United was somewhere between 20 eighty million dollars plus and vastly more than that in reputational damage so the individual risk of bad customer service each instance is very small but it compounds and compounds and compounds until suddenly one will take off another example was radio pranking in Australia there's a habit on certain kinds of radio programs where they folk people up to put them down to trick them and this is actually a form of violence propping oneself up by putting other down in this case they pranked a nurse into thinking that a nurse in the hospital where one of the royal family was having difficulties with the pregnancy they tricked her into thinking that this was Prince Charles talking with her and this was really funny it was their greatest hitting all the rest and then the nurse committed suicide because it's she came from a shaming culture where it is beneath you know it's absolutely possible to hold faith so she died so this happy little prank ended up being me effectively well it cost someone of their life so these were examples of things that can blow up another one I dealt with firsthand was a bank in a latin-american country country which had pushed its pushed out credit cards to financially largely illiterate people without telling them that they had to get the money back to pay the money back though she told them it was free money the reputational damage there was so huge that they went from the most respected in village in the region to the least in just six months to the point where their own staff were telling people that they no longer work there so the costs of ignoring structural issues like this can be enormous and the more it goes on the longer it runs the higher the risk grows and that's a kurtosis risk the long-term risk what we do to address them it's we first of all identify what the factors are but if there are factors there that are basically propping self up by putting others down or by offloading responsibility on to the on to others then you know that there's a risk there but it's fairly easy to calculate what the risk is generally speaking we can't afford to ignore them so the risk increases with repetition the other one is one of the mutual responsibilities for checks and balances you remove the risk or mitigate the risk by dealing with mutual responsibilities from working out what they are but ensuring that the checks and balances are fully in place if you have something that's designed on propping someone else but prepping self up by putting someone else down or offloading responsibility onto another these are kurtosis risks that can destroy a business enterprise architects need to take these these risks and very seriously indeed
