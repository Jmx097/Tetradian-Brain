in this episode I want to continue on with this concept of myth quakes and particularly how we can measure them in order to be able to prepare interventions from an enterprise architecture perspective now remember a myth in this context is an untested or unverified assumption something that we assume to be so and a myth quake occurs whenever we have a conflict between that myth and reality the analogy here is with with an earthquake hence myth quake remember that there are two quite different scales in earthquake models there's the Rita scale which measures the energy on the Macaulay scale which is more about impact there's a friendly given earthquake there's a single level of energy but an infinite range of impacts now for this I'm looking really at a myth quake scale there's more about impact in terms of particularly its impact on lives so a myth quick zero I've got a ten level scale a myth quick zero these are everyday upsets that happen all the time continuously all through the day every time we have a little conflict now that should have worked that didn't work what's wrong that's a very simple first level myth quake a myth quake one is where it starts to have real effects on people's lives so for example every minute of every day around 200 people will meet up with a myth quake around the myth of I gonna live forever and then discover that they don't a myth quake ii particularly is what we relates to what we might call the terrible twos it's particularly around that i am the center of the world the relationship between IE versus other produces all manner of myth quakes then can be quite lethal when they're in a medium scale environment so we can put that up at myth quake ii affecting up to 100 lives miss quakes is the world of work I and what I do when what I do ceases to exist it's like an existential problem if I cease to do the work that I'm was B was doing if I lose my job I no longer exist now this when a company closes this can affect thousands of people that's a myth quake3 a myth quake 4 affecting 10,000 people or more is typical mainstream politics whoever you voted for the government got in and that's the kind of fear where a government policy is going to affect thousands of lives sometimes tens of thousands removing people's ability to live for removing this that and the other happens at a larger scale than a smaller cut than a single company and can affect tens of thousands of lives at a time but in with quake 5 level one of the examples they use here is the whole money system the way that our economics is based on assumptions about how people interact about how some people should trade this can a fairly minor matter can affect a hundred thousand lives an economic crash for example because of failed assumptions about money can easily affect hundreds of thousands of lives at a myth quake six level it's more about what people believe to be true we see things like meaning about religion about beliefs about science beliefs there are larger scope than just politics but Rx again existential assumptions which when challenged can affect literally millions of lives the next level up we're talking about the whole I am Who I am and particularly when someone else decides that you should not be or should not exist because of what you are things that of which you have no choice at all such as race gender sexual orientation ethnic group so both social class of birth all of these things of which you have no control these kind of easily affect tens upon tens of millions of lives particularly when we see things like a religious war break out or when we get race racial attacks on a particular group the next one is myth quake eight we're up in the tens of millions of lives range here is ideas that are fundamental but actually don't work now one of them for me is the concept of rights rights are a kind of assumption that it's often not so much about rights but about the evasion of responsibility and causes things to fail that this can be up in huge levels particularly when we start looking at our responsibilities in relation to the world in which we live and for me a myth quake 9 which is running right up against extinction levels kind of what kind of levels of worry oh the whole myth around the idea of possession that I possess that it's all about me so that's a scale we can use to measure and identify the types of interactions that occur the types of risks that are involved and also why this is so darned important because practicing on the small earthquakes allows us to work on the big ones from an enterprise architecture perspective this scale we mostly deal with in enterprise architecture we mostly deal with issues that are at most around myth quake for around the world of work in the world of politics but some are heading right up into myth quake seven with the whole issues around diversity and the social media that were the whole social media in which we live is heading very fast towards some very real myth quake 9 level myth quakes we need to deal with faced with these we need to start tackling them and we need the tools to do it that's why this is important you
