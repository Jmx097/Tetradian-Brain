for this episode gun Subhan Allah asks how do we model a business book glossary who are the actors who can we run a workshop how do we get consensus on definitions where do we start which business areas and how do we visually store in a simple way well the first place that we want to start with glossary is to find existing glossary x' lookup industry standards lookup industry specifications and use those at least as a base that you can then start to talk with people about about how it's going to vary from there what's specific to our organization and how do we anchor it back to industry standards or other standards to find who the actors would be we would use the capability model such as we talked about in the previous two episodes the capability model is straightaway telling us the kinds of people that were looking for and the kinds of information and definitions that they're likely to work on so use that capability model and ask around for who's got the phone numbers all the directories people who've already marked up their own version of that I like to have information about who we can talk with the next thing we want to do is to have a workshop which is about context specific variances so we don't need to start from scratch we start from the existing glossary and then ask people what the variances are what the local acronyms are that you then find that you've got 15 different meanings for the same nominal acronym that are scattered all over the organization which means you're going to need a thesaurus a sounds like thesaurus a is the same as is different from is an extension of is a subunit of is an aggregation of these are standard ophisaurus terms dublin core is one of the standards that we might use to map out how these terms relate with each other and the first point here is that we are never going to get actual consensus what we need to do is to map out local meanings and build a consensus locally often at the time but have something use the thesaurus and the glossary as an anchor for conversations now how to publish it how to make it officially accessible what we did in Telstra a large Australian telecom was we had what we called a jargon Buster was up in the top right hand corner of the screen and you could type in anything these days you would probably avoid use voice into interface to look at anything but you need a continual update for this someone who acts as a moderator you can't just do it once it's not a project it's a continuous process but what happened was that if you typed up a term it would produce what was effectively a wiki page of all of the matches the suggested meanings but also warned you of other variances by looking up not just the glossary but the thesaurus could warn or other things that might sound like it like I remember an absolute doozy was where we found that ISO which most people think of as international standards organization in one area ISO was a standard acronym for internal service order so we had to we knew we had to be careful in that space as to what terms were used but now we had the glossary the list of definitions and the thesaurus the relationship and clashes between the different definitions it became possible to make sense and then people maintained it themselves working through a moderator so you have the glossary is itself you have the actors you've got the means for maintaining it you accept that you will never actually get consensus what you do is accept differences and work with them how to start that is by working and mapping to the capability model and we store it with something or access it by something like a jargon buster straightforward how to model a business glossary and more to the point how to use a business glossary in any organizational context
