one of the things that the corona virus pandemic is thinking about hard is the whole concept of money and the money economy it's a lawsuit of the possession economy like I looked at in a previous video and it's the main means by which we managed anything its monies are essentially our only main means of managing resources and the flow of resources that's one of the reasons why money is called currency because it deals with the flood but depends on this rather odd idea of valuation that some things are valued as higher than others or more important than others but particularly we need money to access resources but somehow in an odd way some jobs are classed as more important than others or socially important or the higher you are tomorrow in a hierarchy the more you should I often wonder whether that's actually appropriate and one of the things that has really come up been highlighted by the pandemic is the complete failure in many different ways of so many aspects of the money economy in many ways it just doesn't work and this is really obvious now for example social distancing and has forced a separation between the haves and the have-nots in an incredibly arbitrary way that some jobs are classed as essential and other jobs are classed as you can aren't essential and you must not be at work because you must not be with the other people so I've now got people out of work for my thinking the states for example it's now 22 million unemployed is a incredible job vast numbers of people who've never been unemployed before in some cases are suddenly unemployed and therefore have no income because access to resources is linked to being at work on behalf of someone else the out killings remain the same but suddenly the and many people simply don't have savings to cover that kind of gap which is what the money system tells us to do is to have savings the other one is that we've got a really interesting highlight that's happened where suddenly all of the work that's classed as essential particular health care and keeping things clean and bus drivers and so on all of those things that are classed essential are mostly done by people with the lowest income and the people who are but the very highest think I'll still remain work because they're in control of it but the people in the middle who are used to having an income but classed as a non-essential because to be very interesting all the boundaries around that that we normally pay the people who do what we now understand is essentially the least the closer you get to doing real tangible essential work the less you get played this is an odd way to structure an economy so bluntly there's a major rethink required not only as we've seen before that the possession economy is not sustainable whether long-term so money economy was it which is its main external form also doesn't work and what is interesting is that we can replace in theory at least we can replace every single monetary agenda transaction with the one short forward phrase what do you need whatever the means are the VATS for how we should be managing the resources a money economy or a possession economy guarantees that the resources will naturally move to where they're least needed not to where they must need it so some huge issues that willing to do to rethink an economy completely without money we don't actually need it it's a really bad way to manage resources it doesn't work and we don't even need anyway so it's quite interesting to go down a high street for example or the shopping mall and look at the shops that were remained exactly the same if there are no money in the economy as opposed to the things that would banks and insurances taxes all of those almost all of those would vanish overnight they've got no actual functioning a viable economy there's some really interesting ways and interesting challenges about how we rethink our entire economics at a global scale without money
