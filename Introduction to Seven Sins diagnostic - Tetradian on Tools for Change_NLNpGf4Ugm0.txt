in the previous video I talked about the skill modes map about different ways of working ways of thinking which recalled the artist the scientist the believer and the technician the Builder the what we need particularly with those is winning because we need all of them at different points within a project or with any kind of change those different types of skills or mindsets we need to be clear which one we are using at any given time and there's a very real discipline required about how to move between them and when to move but to know what happens most of the failures that we see in business and elsewhere a rightful lack of discipline in those spaces and some of them such clear patterns that I ended up calling them the seven sins of dubious discipline because they so commonly reflect failure to move around between the disciplines in a different way the different domains so the word sin is not come it's bad but it's actually if you look at the historical meaning it just means ignorance it means a failure it means it's not bad it's not evil it's just these are things that we need to watch for and make sure that we resolve so most of these sins arise from a failure to switch between the bones correctly so the first one of these is what we call the hype hubris there is all that matter of excitement and hype and big gushing stuff which is all about the new idea jumping straight to the believer so it's jumping straight to the Builder saying it can be done but then leaping straight to the believer saying that this is the answer and we see this so much in enterprise architecture following the latest shiny new toy the new new technology that you method the new whatever we need to focus on are we following the disciplines correctly are we using the right modes of the right sequence and not getting caught up on the hype the second of these is another variant of it which is that when we get to the future or sometimes in the past there was a golden age and it's another form of the believer it's picking up on an idea usually without even looking at it at all by going first to the Builder and then rushing straight into this is the answer so there's not even looking at the idea at all it is saying this is the answer completely unexamined so the risks are incredibly high the third one is what are sometimes called the new each nuisance the new age nuisance if you like it runs with series the discarded remnant of what was once nutritious basically this is a complete failure of discipline of any kind in fact not just a failure it's an active avoidance of discipline when challenged about the quality of the ideas they'll jump to the believer and say it's the truth when charged about the belief they will lead to the scientist and say look it to be proved by someone else but I want brother to view the references when challenged about the science about is it in the use so they would jump to the the engineer and said look say look this has be true proven somewhere but aren't anywhere there's this jumping around that we see particularly in poor quality work in the consultancy space where we're leaping to ideas where but we're never actually allowing ourselves to be pinned down to any form of discipline that's the newest nuisance the next one is actually a failure mostly in the scientist space it's called the meaning mistake and it's when an idea is allowed to go half-baked where you haven't actually checked everything but you're leaping straight into production how many times have we seen this in startups how many times have we seen this in that in HR where people are leaping into production without being tested it's still half-baked now some extent if you look at a classic development cycle with initial idea to alpha test to beta test to pre production to production that's actually following the disciplines correctly an alpha test we know isn't gonna work a beta tester should mostly work on what we're checking is whether is where it fails it shouldn't go into production - it's proven so those are that's without the fail the meaning mistake is leaping straight into production but also another one is where we make an assumption and build a whole structure on it without actually checking that the assumptions were correct and this happens again a lot just as an example at the time I'm videoing this the corona virus pandemic has really shown the fragility of a just-in-time manufacture when half of you half of your supply chain is broken in some way or another so watch for the assumptions and that's what the meaning mistake and the discipline the word try to resolve that to get out of the meaning mistake is to check our assumptions in every stage the next one is what we call the position problem and that's that I have the truth there is a very strong tendency to have to be the consultant or the manager is the person who has the truth but there's no actual check it's just I possess this likewise it is correct that I possess the money and therefore you have to do what I say or we will convert everyone else's investment into money and then I can then take it because I have the rights to the money there are a lot of rights type problems that arise in that space another one another issue that arises is what we call the reality risk which is failure to realize that when you're working in an imaginary space when you're working with new ideas there is distinction between real and imaginary when you're imagining something it is as if it is real the danger which occurs in the reality risk is that people will assume that something which you they are working with as if true is itself true and then can upset what it turns out to be true when they thought it was only as if so there are some real issues here around what is real and what is not you know don't call for things that you want to be would like to be real without realizing the consequences if they become real we see a lot in that in politics for example as well as in business the number one simple example is don't wish for scaling if you're not ready for it there are very real issues they're about being ready for things when they change the defining one isn't quite so much of a sin as such but it's one that we see a lot which is what I call lost in the learning labyrinth the learning process is not a linear statement in your progression it's it has a lot of odd starts and finishes the beginner's luck moment that happens only at the beginning and that we don't get anywhere else again the classic one of the moment where there's a moment of absolute despair and then to sudden breakthrough and the mistake is thinking that that's on the moment of breakthrough is mastery when in fact it's only just the beginning of the journeyman's wrote well so there are lots of issues around there so those are our seven different mistake as seven different sins if you like the hype hubris about getting lost in the big hike about something the golden age which is making a grand assumption that assert something in the past or something in the imaginative future is going to be perfection the new-age nuisance where there's a complete absence of discipline at all there is the meaning mistake where we jump to assumptions and check there is the possession problem where we believe that we alone could have the rights to possess something rather than the responsibilities that go with it there's the reality risk of failing to make a clear difference between ears and as if it were certain that something is is true as if true are very different things it's really really important not to mix up and the risk of getting lost in the learning labyrinth the development stage there now it's a lot more in the blog posts and elsewhere that are listed in the description of YouTube do have a look at this because they will really help you avoid these traps in terms of moving around between the different skill sets and modes that are required so the way we resolve these is we need to keep track of what mode we are in at each time versus the mode that we need to be at each moment in time and move cleanly between them according to how we're doing it so that's the seven sins diagnostic it's a useful if very disturbing at times diagnostic to help avoid some of the traps that we walk into thanks for watching do look at the youtube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
