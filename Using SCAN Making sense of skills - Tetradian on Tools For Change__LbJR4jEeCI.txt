in a previous video we introduced a frame called scan which gives us a very simple way to help make sense of complexity it's essentially just two axes one of them is the amount of time before and after a given now and an axis of certainty versus uncertainty predictability versus unpredictability sameness versus difference uniqueness and as before what we've mentioned was that you can actually divide this into something like a four quadrant model which is on the ones hand there's a transition from if we do the same thing we'll get the same results so if we do something different we may get the same results or if we do the same thing we may get something different so on this side it's very much rule-based on this side it's very much skill based now that can move around a lot and also there's a transition between the time we have to think about it versus the higher time we have to do something yeah at the moment of commitment towards action where we have to decide so we talked before about the kind of methods we use the algorithms up here we're using algorithms and calculation down here we really don't have time but to follow the rules we need work instructions at this place it's about the rule following the rules that will give us the results of certainty up here we've got heuristics and patterns whereas down in this area where we're dealing with real time deep uncertainty especially over here we're going to need principles to guide us principles and values we can also describe this though in terms of skill level classically these would be the trainee the apprentice what we might call the entrance to the trade where you start being able to deal with the real uncertainties classically you call this person a journeyman and finally you have a master a masters job is to deal with any kind of uncertainty in real time in accordance with what we're trying to do now in a previous video we've talked about some of the transitions that apply here and in an other videos we've talked about the different modes of thinking that are necessary to make this work so a trainee tends to be very much a believer they have to do what they're told and really nothing else the apprentice starts to learn what's going on the danger with an apprentice is that they start to believe that they know the rules and can control the rules by rich real work is done but they actually have no real experience of dealing with uncertainty over here the danger with the apprentice and we see this so often in different trades is that they have just enough trouble and just just enough skill to get into trouble just enough knowledge and nothing like enough knowledge to get out of trouble again so the trainee is always deeply supervised and it has to follow the rules the apprentice is learning what the rules are and the factors that control them but they need deep supervision and very often should not be let loose anywhere near anything a journeyman should be able to deal with the uncertainties but will need supervision and then the to prove that they have gone past the journeyman phase they will do what's known as a master piece literally to prove that they have the skill levels of a master that they can deal with the uncertainties of the real world the master's job is to deal with those uncertainties so there's a path that happens here a very clear development path from trainee to apprentice to journeyman and then on to the master now one of the practical problems is that the master can't explain what they're doing they can't derive that don't have time to derive in real time an explanation of what they're doing they're often winging it on the basis of principles so they're not good people to explain to apprentices what's going on that's what the journeyman's job is is to get the next level of apprentice so your organization needs this transition but to do it you also need remember what this bounder is time to think versus no time to think now notice what happens if we don't allow people time to think we end up with a system that consists solely of trainees and masters and no way that a trainee can actually develop into becoming a master what happens in a lot of organizations is that when there's a huge pressure to produce produce produce or when no one is allowing time for people to go through that path you end up with an organization that when it loses the people who started it off there's no way to keep it going an organization that does not allow time to reflect time to develop will destroy itself in the longer term these are the kind of things that scan can help us identify what kinds of skills we need what kind of methods we're going to use in each case the skill level we need for different types of concerns between truth on one side which are putting quotes in other words what is supposed to be the rules versus value or usefulness certain this needs certainty but can't deal with the uncertainties of the real world so there is a development path going here so scan is helping us to identify which of these are applying at each given circumstance and how we build the skill levels and what we need to build the skill levels to help people become the masters that we need to deal with the uncertainties of the real world thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further
