in this video we'll look at a tool called five elements or seaspar context scope plan action review the aim is it's a consistent method to guide change that we pull other tools in but it keeps a consistency across the whole well shown it as a loop here but there are various other layouts because we have to deal with any level of complexity what we do is we start with a question such as how are we going to use artificial intelligence in our business so we set up a team it could be a team of one but the idea is that we need diversity we need a number of different perspectives to get the best best possibility of finding appropriate ideas information and insights we need someone which we might call the Pathfinder or guide a role which is to keep us on track and avoid getting lost down the rabbit hole which has happens a lot it's also to make sure that we do our that we are doing the right things an another role we might use is what we might call the recorder or the scribe the role here is to capture ideas insights and information in the heat of the action in the heat of exploration it's very easy to lose these so it's useful to assign one person to do this job for us we then start at context at look at purpose look at the why look at where the question fits look at where the success criteria are for example if our question is how should we use AI in our business the first question first success criteria is that we want to have a good answer for what how are we going to use AI as we look at this bigger picture we start seeing gaps that we need to fill places that we don't have the information that we need those become our scope or scopes for action scopes for further exploration we then move to scope we look at the people issues look at the WHO side of the question what we want out of here is a bunch of project specs but we need to know who the stakeholders are and we need to know the skillsets those kind of issues that are essential to getting a project started once we've got those we can start moving on a plan now before the focus of the previous two areas was are we doing the right things here we're going to be doing the usual do things right if we rush straight to plan from the question we're going to miss out that first really important thing about is this the right thing to be doing so we do the usual planned stuff we're doing the standard preparation getting things in place and making sure that we know what we want to do it's often very recursive very iterative looping round through through action and reviews in an in kind of recursive way but we move when we're in action when we're going to the action itself there's no time to stop and think that's why we need the plan in place that's why we need the guidance in place that's why we need the recorder because otherwise we're going to miss a lot of the information that we gather together and after every action we need a review continuous improvement depends on an after-action review after every piece of action so this provides a consistent way to check what we're doing we'll have a separate video about a tool to look at how to do after-action reviews but we're going to look at the success criteria that we came up with in the original work on purpose because that then closes the loop we have success criteria checked in review in review we're making sure that it all works together when we add complexity and scale when there's lots of things going on all the time in with multiple teams working on different issues in different levels and different stages of that sequence we're going to need some kind of coordinator to make sure that everything links together and we're also going to need some kind of vision or enterprise story to hold it all together they give us the values that work that help us make decisions to guide decisions in real time practice so we bring those all those together we've got all the individual teams we have the explorers in the teams we have for each team we have a a guide for each team we have a we have overall a coordinator and we have this kind of ringmaster and the vision that holds it all together so context scope plan action and review it's actually the same for every type of content or context the same at every scope or scale a consistent method to help us guide how change will work thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
