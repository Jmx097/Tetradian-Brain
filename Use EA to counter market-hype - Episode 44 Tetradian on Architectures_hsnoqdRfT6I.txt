Alan Lloyd asks me how to how we can use enterprise architecture to counter market hype now by market hike we mean things like the dreaded buzzwords like blockchain bimodal i.t digital transformation we've all heard the buzzwords are they actually any use and if they're not how can we use them how can we mitigate against them the real problem here is what we unkindly described as in flight strategy which is where some senior executives says this is the future I've read it in an in-flight magazine what we need is to cross-check this to reality on the one side we need to cross-check it to the enterprise's identity the organization's big picture the purpose within that global space so we need to check against the enterprise story will bimodal IT help us improve with the way we are interacting with the big picture story does this fancy idea of digital transformation how would this actually help in connecting to the big picture vision of for example Ted's vision of ideas worth spreading what would digital transformation look like and how would it actually help the story if there's no if we can't answer that in a supportive way with enterprise architecture or other if Enterprise Architecture doesn't support that then we probably shouldn't be chasing after this fancy new piece of hype on the other side we want to do a cross-check to execution to keep bootys do we actually have the ability to do this fancy new change what would it what impact would it have what change would it make are people likely to be able to go along with the change and wouldn't actually put us at risk by cannibalizing from other areas so this is where we really need to look at things like dynamics the chair won't change the rate of change for skills that we have to do this and what the trade-offs are and this is where tools like Wadley Maps coming because they show us the dynamics of how the whole market is changed how old technology is changing is moving from highly bespoke through to just commodity if something is becoming a commodity we should not be building it miss bug so our enterprise architecture looks at the whole picture looking upward to the big picture story the enterprise story the the purpose and the way we our organization is interacting in that space and what look for what advantage if any this new piece of hype could give us on the other side going down towards reality we're looking at the dynamics the trade-offs what impact would this really have compared to the capabilities that we have available or that we would have to create in order to follow up this piece of hype so there are quite a few ways we can use an enterprise architecture to gain a sense of how some piece of marketing path might actually be or not be useful in the way our organization operates
