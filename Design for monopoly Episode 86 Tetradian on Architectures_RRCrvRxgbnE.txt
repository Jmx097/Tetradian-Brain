in designing for enterprises story there's one particular kind of enterprise one particular kind of story that we need to take particular care about and that's a situation of a monopoly for example government by definition is a monopoly because it literally comes with the territory it's always there now that kind of market space that kind of story only succeeds when all of the players in that space are adequately served dominance of a market where you can pick and choose is not the same as a monopoly because if someone's left out the story fails that's not the same as you know that the organization is itself covering the whole of the enterprise we get some very interesting or very worrying concerns about this when something that is effectively a monopoly starts abandoning some parts of the enterprise a good example of this is banks or other services that are abandoning small communities without those kids without those services the bank the whole community may fail another example is public transport or public services generally if we've assigned these things that are effectively monopolies to a commercial organization that then drops out because it's not commercially set viable to do it we're actually breaking the whole story the services have to come from somewhere and across the whole doing it purely on a commercial basis may not actually work because a monopoly brings fundamentally different responsibilities we have to serve everyone by definition we in fact don't have customers we have citizens they are citizens of the story that we are claiming to serve all of we can't cherry pick because firstly that becomes increasingly inefficient over the whole and secondly if we simply cut some people out we're betraying the story there are major trust issues because if we betrayed some players it shifts rapidly from commercial to political and we can't play the games of privatized profit socialites risk because again it turns political very very painful ways so designing for a monopoly is different from designing for playing only one part of a story within a within an enterprise in a monopoly we're actually taking over the whole of the story with all that that applies
