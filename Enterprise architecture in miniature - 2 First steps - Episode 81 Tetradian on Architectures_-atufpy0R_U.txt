continuing on from this idea about enterprise architecture in miniature about looking at the really small scale the enterprise from one person organization looking at this idea of vandalize about traveling around in a vehicle and building a vehicle and a business model that will work around that idea around teaching so first part of this is a kind of iterative design process things are going to change we know they're going to change so there are lots and lots and lots of little ideas some of them coming up as insights from unexpected directions all of them we want to capture working iteratively towards a viable work idea so a notebook becomes really important also this whole idea of context scope plan action or review we identify something within the within the overall scope or the overall context work on a piece of scope setting an area to work on do a brief plan about idea about what we're going to look at do the looking at it do a review which itself produces new ideas but we also start from the story the enterprise is what gives us the story and the values and success criteria that we need to make this all work so what does success look like well success is when people are satisfied when I'm satisfied that I'm enjoying the work that I do everything affects also offense everything else there are scopes of function we've got power heat light air flow water communications access storage all of these are happening in the same very small space we're looking at all the different scopes of use work rest play move MOOC having the vehicle to move itself we're looking at value themes such as privacy security environment financials is it financially viable can I maintain it is it reliable is what about the hygiene issues about keeping clean keeping comfortable keeping healthy about adaptation and reuse about using it as a live demonstrator of everything that I'm doing so that the enterprise is reflecting back on itself to demonstrate the principles by which it was designed in the principles by which it's used and we're also designing to all of the constraints which themselves also interact in very complex interweaving ways so every choice every everything involves a trade-off when we're looking at a scope of function another scope is affected another scope is affected try to push more space there loses space here when everything's tightly controlled by constraints so these were the first steps about an architecture of a one-person organization building to us towards a story
