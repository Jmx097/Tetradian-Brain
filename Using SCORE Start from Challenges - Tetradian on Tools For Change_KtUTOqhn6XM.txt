in this series we're exploring how to use the score frame very simple frame for making sense of any kind of strategic or it's really your issue or strategic choice of some kind really making sense of anything in terms of what choices we have and what we can do so one of the challenges that people have or one of the questions is where do we start well we use the starting point the question that work trying to address to give us a cue so in this case we've got a question of who will replace our CMO on her maternity leave well straight away that suggests it's a challenge so we're going to start here it's a challenge to us we don't know what to do when effect we're losing a capability well one of the points here is that straight away we notice that we want to be considered continue being best employer we need continuity and we need responsiveness the continuity particularly for customers is a concern so where do we go well the first one is follow the ideas what does that suggest well first of all we're going to need to replace someone but actually it's not so you would straight away we'd see that as a possible risk there is a risk here of loss of continuity which is what clashes with all of these but if we look at it we've already got a strength here in terms of how we do our business because it's actually the same as a holiday it's just a very long holiday we already have a mechanism for continuity over vacation if she's going to be away for a week two weeks on vacation then clearly we've got to have someone to replace her for that time so what we can do here is we can look for what were the responses before when she was away what did we use who replaced her on vacation there's a mechanism for doing it and a proven mechanism to do it now the important point is this is not a recruitment so it's it's easy to think of this as a recruitment issue and in fact it could be we don't know if she would choose at the end of this to say no I'm not coming back that's always an issue for any parent so we'll put that in there do does she intend to return given that what are the risks there if we don't know if she's going to return so we've got to deal with and face the uncertainty this is a self as a challenge so facing uncertainty but one place we could look for for some kind of Solace if we're not sure of how to do it what happens with everyone else so really all we're doing here is we're following trails looking for ideas looking for hints dealing with particularly working with the uncertainty that will then produce new capabilities that we can use so the key point of with all of this is not building lists but building understanding building insights that's how we use score to make sense of uncertain situations when we're starting from a challenge [Music] thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
