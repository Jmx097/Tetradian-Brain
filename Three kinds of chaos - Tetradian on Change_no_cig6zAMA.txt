when working with change often this will say that the one thing we most want to avoid is chaos but actually that's not quite right and one of the problems here is that there are three completely different things that are all called chaos so the usual idea is that we go from order collapsing into chaos it's not again not actually quite right so what's commonly called the kind of end chaos is actually extreme self-order the system that we're in has settled out to an order that cannot be changed and while we whilst we might call that chaos it's act because it's not what we want it's is actually a form of order likewise when we're working on change on change projects or whatever or when we're dealing with situations we have what we would call chaos you know a collapse into chaos which can still be changed and that's actually a collapse not into chaos but into undesired self-order for example in the background you hear various noises i can't control those those are undesired self-order but what i can do is work with them and find ways to adapt to them to change them where i can to adapt to them where i can't but that kind of chaos is actually we need to look more closely at what kind of desires we have and the third kind of chaos is what's classically called the void it's actually the reason of all possibility we cannot have change without going into a space of chaos to use the old nature phrase you must have chaos within you to find a dancing star so chaos is often what we actually want it's the space in which we reach for possible possibilities for change is also called chaos so we've got three completely different things that are called chaos one is the region of possibility which we want there's undesired self-order which we don't want but we have a chance still to change and there is the final undesired self-order where no possibility of change is available they're all called chaos but be very careful not to mix them up
