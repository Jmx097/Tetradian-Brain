I want to start a short series on rethinking projects about what we mean by projects and how change actually happens and start point for this one is about a framework called five elements which we use intensively in our own work what we're after is a method or a framework a governance framework that works exactly the same way and every scope and every scale for any type of context for any type of content because we've got so many different methods that we use for different projects and different types of contexts that it gets hopelessly confusing if we don't have something to link them all together so if we look at the project lifecycle the classic sequence of forming storming and norming it continues on to performing and then a journey the wrap-up at the end of a project cycle but we talk about it as being a cycle because in fact it's not just a one-off we don't just go from forming storming norming performing a journey but we loop back round we continually do new projects one project leads to another so the sequence of forming storming and so on gives us what we might think I was five spaces around a call each other in each of these spaces we're collecting different types of information as we do a change so that the first one is what we might call purpose forming forming an idea what's our purpose here what's the context what's the why that underpins it what are the constraints that we need to use one of the definitions of what success would look like how do we know what some kind of outcome successful outcome what would they look like what would it feel or how would we find out what that's going to be the next area of the storming phase is also we we tend to call people it's about rather than about context about big picture we're now coming back down to scopes for action finding out things that we can usefully do about whatever we'll use brought into the question into us a question we look at who the stakeholders are here we look at how who is it going to be involved we also need to look at things like skills because skills are often absolutely critical and cannot be just simply bought out of the box particularly when a skill is in high demand or takes a long time to learn so in that people space we look at the scope scopes for action we look at who's going to be involved in in a kind of brassy sense responsible accountable consulting engaged and what the skills and uncertainties are we then move on to preparation about the weather plan comes from about how are we going to do whatever it is we're going to do but we work our way down from most abstract to most concrete as we bring it down towards something happening for real in the print in the next area we actually move into action this is in real time it's happening in them now it's what's going on right now what information are we capturing about what's going on we're looking for evidence and also for how we deal with things that don't fit our expectations because that's also the place where we capture insights then finally we have the performance space while we're looking for outcomes choices and commitments for change what are the lessons learned here how can we use what we've done to learn what to do next now connecting all of these together is the kind of central space a kind of pivot what we sometimes call the atrium which is about coordination about sequence about priorities about what we're going to choose to do next which things have to come first how do we decide to how to move things around so we've got these five spaces around a core purpose people preparation process and performance around this central core of how things work together and that gives us something that works roughly the same way every scope every scale every context every type of content that helps us start to rethink how we do projects right from the start
