# Analysis: Enterprise architecture and coronavirus: Parasites: Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video warns enterprise architects and citizens about the risks of "disaster capitalism" as societies emerge from COVID-19 lockdowns, where exploitative investors like parasites, grazers, predators, and scavengers prey on the vulnerable. It critiques win-lose dynamics as illusory short-term gains leading to long-term lose-lose outcomes for society, urging a shift toward win-win fairness. Protection requires self-reflection and restructuring social systems that favor predators over symbiotic partners.

## Key Takeaways
- Investors fall into five categories: **symbiotes** (mutually beneficial), **parasites** (take without giving), **grazers** (temporary exploitation across many), **predators** (aggressive takers), and **scavengers** (opportunistic displacers without effort).
- Disaster capitalism exploits financial and emotional stress post-lockdown, worsening inequalities as resource-rich entities grab opportunities while others rebuild from scratch.
- Win-lose approaches are addictive illusions masking race-to-the-bottom losses; true sustainability demands win-win choices, as lose-lose is the only alternative.
- Social structures like stock markets prioritize scavengers over symbiotes, enabling parasites; enterprise architects must counter this as citizens and professionals.
- Individuals must self-check for "bargain-hunting" from others' pain to avoid supporting parasites that destroy society.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Beware disaster capitalism**: Vigilantly identify and resist exploitative practices in post-lockdown recovery, especially in enterprise architecture roles involving resource allocation.
- **Check for fairness**: In every decision, assess fairness to self and others—avoid profiting from others' pain, such as snapping up distressed assets.
- **Rethink investor priorities**: Advocate restructuring systems (e.g., stock markets) to favor symbiotes first, protecting against parasites, grazers, predators, and scavengers.
- **Promote win-win**: Reject win-lose temptations in dealings; focus on mutual long-term gains to avoid addictive short-term highs leading to societal collapse.
