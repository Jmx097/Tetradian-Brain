# Analysis: Change-mapping: Information-capture - Tetradian on Tools for Change

## Executive Summary
This video explains change-mapping as a method to systematically capture ideas, insights, and information across five domains—context, scope, plan, action, and review—to track progress in any change initiative. It emphasizes maintaining connection to the big picture while handling uncertainties and learning from variances. The approach applies universally regardless of scale, content, or context.

## Key Takeaways
- Change-mapping builds a comprehensive map of change by collecting domain-specific information to stay oriented amid uncertainty.
- **Context** focuses on big-picture elements like vision, values, standards, and laws to guide all subsequent stages.
- **Scope** involves partitioning work by defining boundaries, skills, stakeholders, and reasons, always linking back to context.
- **Plan** resolves uncertainties through iterative setup of instructions, start/end conditions, and information capture methods, using a "bubble metaphor" for skill-based uncertainty tolerance.
- **Action** executes the plan while capturing essential information for learning and review.
- **Review** assesses benefits realization, identifies variances, and commits to personal/team changes for future iterations.
- The core principle remains consistent across all change scenarios, supported by tool-sheets and missions detailed in related resources.[1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- In **context**, collect vision statements, values, standards, and laws; use these to anchor even small-scale work and maintain stability in uncertainty.
- In **scope**, identify stakeholders, roles ("who does what"), boundaries, and skills; ensure choices align with context to prevent scope drift.
- In **plan**, define start/end signals, iteratively resolve uncertainties (shrink the "bubble" based on skill levels), and setup information capture linked to prior domains.
- In **action**, follow plan specifications while actively capturing arising information for review.
- In **review**, compare realized benefits against context/scope/plan, analyze variances (what worked/didn't), and commit to specific personal/team learning actions.
- Use Change-mapping missions with tool-sheets (e.g., Context tool-sheet#1, Review tool-sheet#1) for structured exploration; scale via parallel or large missions as needed.[1]

## Quotes
- "Our aim is to capture ideas insights and information that we can use we want to be able to keep track of where we are hints change mapping building a map of every part of the change."
- "Vision in action when we are completely lost we know what's going on but said to help us keep stable in the midst of deep uncertainty."
- "We have to shrink of the bubble in order to get through the skill level determines how big that space is going to be."
- "One of the common traps is that people know when to start but they don't know when to end particular if there's no obvious end point."
- "If there's a variance then look at the variance look at what worked well as well as what didn't work well look for all of that information about what we need to change."
- "Regardless of scope scale content or context it's all the ways the same the core principle is always the same in change mapping."
