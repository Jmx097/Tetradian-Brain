for this episode I want to come back to something we touched on in episode 34 about what is an enterprise because one of the major issues we face is a problem where people keep confusing the organization than the enterprise they're not the same thing the first point is that an organization is bounded by is a administrative structure it's bounded by rules roles and responsibilities whereas an enterprise is actually quite different it's an emotive structure that's bounded by story it's bounded by commitments is bounded by feelings it's a completely different thing we need to make sure that we don't confuse them now they can overlap but in the case where we say the organization is the enterprise it's an organization that's just talking to itself there's no story there so we build an organization for an organization but about the enterprise in which its operating in order to understand what the stories are what the interactions are how we get past things like the service boundary how we get past and understand things like service ship like service journeys like the whole process of interacting with a customer and beyond so the classic EA was based on what we call inside in it was about only about the orc of the internals of the organization itself without really anything reference to anything outside at all later on by the time we get into the early 2000s we start getting the beginnings of enterprise-wide IT architecture with a bit of business architecture but essentially business architecture is defined as anything not IT that might affect IT we don't really get customer journeys or service journeys so that's starting to happen now but we need to look much further because the danger is that when we look at this first outside inside out looking outward from the inside we place ourselves as the center of everyone else's universe and as Chris Potts put it customers do not appear in our processes we appear in their experiences so we also need to look at it from outside looking in what is the world like from the customers perspective what is the enterprise that we share with our suppliers with our customers with the broader world such as regulators journalists true recruiters anyone else in that kind of direct interaction space but taking it further beyond that's what we could call outside out the exact corollary of the looking inside itself is the outside looking at itself but look at the story looking at itself and there if we are believed to be betraying the story we're going to be in trouble so we need an architecture that understands all the way out to quite a long way beyond the organization itself a real practical example of this is the difference between boundary of identity and boundary of control the boundary of control is what we is it what is inside our organization but if we outsource something then it's outside of our boundary of control but inside our boundary of identity what people see is us so a security guard for example I've had a real example where a security guard destroyed my relationship with a supermarket he wasn't an employee he was a tutor person but he decided that my folding bike which acted as a trolley was therefore a bicycle and could not be imported to the store I know came to that store again another more common one now is things like GDP are where the product that you're so concerned about is outside of your control but you're legally liable for what happens to that personal information so you need to have the ability to extend your architecture and your reach beyond your boundary of control so what happens is that we build an architecture for our organization yes but it's about the shared enterprise that we operate within and if we get these mixed up we can be very in very real trouble for enterprising architecture and our assessments in it often the enterprise can matter first more than the than the organization the organization itself although we build the architecture for it the organization itself comes later than the enterprise
