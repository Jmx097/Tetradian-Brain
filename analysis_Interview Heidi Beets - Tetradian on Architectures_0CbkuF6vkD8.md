# Analysis: Interview: Heidi Beets - Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
Heidi Beets, a business architecture manager in Australia, discusses how enterprise design bridges enterprise architecture and design disciplines by emphasizing shared value over rigid frameworks. She highlights confusion in terminology around business architecture in Australia, where it's often mistaken for IT or business analysis, and shares lessons on finding common ground across teams to deliver customer-focused outcomes.[2][5]

## Key Takeaways
- In Australia, enterprise architecture remains heavily IT-focused, leading to misleading language that confuses business architecture with business analysis or design.[2][5]
- Enterprise design integrates design and architecture, enabling better collaboration by prioritizing problems and opportunities over disciplinary silos.[2][5]
- Frameworks often create friction due to overlaps and differing languages; enterprise design cuts through this by focusing on solution value.[2][5]
- Success comes from finding common ground in shared value creation, avoiding rigid adherence to roles, and tying initiatives to outcomes like cost reduction, reduced complexity, or improved customer experience.[2][5]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- When introducing your role, clarify it as "enterprise architect for the customer, business, and information domains" to bridge understanding gaps.[2][5]
- Always start initiatives by asking "What's the point? What's it gonna do?" and tie back to value: lower operational costs, reduce technical debt/complexity, or enhance customer experience/advocacy.[2][5]
- Collaborate across teams (e.g., customer experience, strategy, data) by focusing on common value rather than frameworks or owned tasks; emphasize that AI demands business rules plus quality data.[2][5]
- Don't always "wear your hat" (stick to your discipline)—seek shared ground to align front- and back-office automation with business outcomes.[2][5]

## Quotes
- "The beauty of enterprise design opposed to just architecture or enterprise architecture is [it] brings together design and architecture so that people can play nicely together and focus on the problems or opportunities rather than a discipline itself."[2][5]
- "Find common ground in the value that you're trying to create don't always wear your hat."[2][5]
- "What's the point what's it gonna do that's the first question... when you tie everything back to what's the value that we're trying to create."[2][5]
