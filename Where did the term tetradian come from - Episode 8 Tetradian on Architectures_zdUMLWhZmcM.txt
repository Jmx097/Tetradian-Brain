a few people have asked me where does the term tat Radian come from well it's actually something we developed originally at Australia Post when we were struggling to get people to think of architecture as more than just the IT what we said and this is a little really simple little tool it's a little pyramid or the paper version of it before it gets cut out looks like this we've got four distinct dimensions or four types of assets or categories of assets if you like we said that any process could be implemented by any appropriate combination of people machines and IT and offering they had to be substitutable for example in emergency we might have to replace all the IT with people in a lot of environments we try to replace the people by machine based processes or IT based processes so we need to understand what was going on on how to describe the differences we came up with what we called for asset dimensions which are physical physical stuff a thing like this data over the virtual dimension which is data information if I give you information I still have it if I give you a physical thing I no longer have it there's a fundamental difference there there's then the relational aspect which is a link between people it's a real asset but we have to be very careful not to confuse the asset which only exists between people and information about that asset which is what we hold in a CRM system they're not the same the other one is what might call aspirational or purpose it's things like brands it's things like the story that underpins an enterprise so the things which people connect to it is are between a person and something abstract and it can be dropped to either end now in a whole one whole enterprise all four of these dimensions are essential it's not just about data so one of the things that this does is it gives us a physical tangible checklist for example when people focus essentially on product they think in terms of the technology the machines and the information what they tend to forget is the purpose the business IT folks often will focus entirely on the business where are we on the business the machines and the information and the information what they'll tend to forget is the people so people so this helps us remember that there are four distinct dimensions another one is that if we place two of them together and over focus on two of them it tends to put the other two in opposition so for example here we've got in from information and machines the classic IT perspective where they tend to put in or position the people side and the business side so we have fights about IT trying to drive the business and forgetting about all of the people so it's a useful way of looking at it any two will put the other two in in opposition we need any three we tend to forget the one that's in the middle the one that's on the other side so we rotate the attention through touch rap Radian four dimensions we can practical pacted that down to Tet Radian so that's what the Tet Radian is or where it came from it's about four distinct assets physical virtual relational and aspirational
