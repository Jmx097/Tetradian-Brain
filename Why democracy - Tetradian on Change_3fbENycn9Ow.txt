it seems opposite right now to look at the idea of democracy that's what democracy actually is what it means where it comes from and why it exists a lot of it approaches to democracy are highly ideological they're about rights and so on but the one that interests me most is the dutch form what's often called polder democracy because if you're farming on the polder you're farming below sea level that means that you've got to get rid of any excess water it can't just drain to the sea because otherwise the sea will drain into you so the only way you can get the water off your land is by passing it to someone else the only way that they can get rid of your water and theirs is to pass it on to someone else again and she's got to get rid of your water his water and you and her water as well all the way out to the to the dike of the polder and the sea now this means that you've got an overall imperative a very pragmatic imperative which is that you've all got to work together because you've got a common issue which is that if you don't get rid of that water you're all going underwater this means that you've got to find ways to work you've got to do the tasks that involve working together you've got to deal with the issues where people can't do those tasks for example if one farmer can't clean his drainage ditches because he's got a broken leg then other people are going to come and help him it's because it's in everyone's interest that this happens if someone refuses to deal with the drainage of the cleaning their drainage ditches you're going to get a problem so you all need to work together to either convince that person that they really do need to clean the drainage ditches for everyone's sake including their own or else that person unfortunately really can't stay on the polder now it doesn't matter what religion someone has whether you like them or not if you don't work together you're all going underwater so this is where things like the role of the bailiff comes in to negotiate with people who either can't or won't do their task you've got a you also got where there are tasks that are larger than any one person can deal with such as building bridges or building larger pumps you've also got to work together at a much larger scale to deal with the dikes themselves and maintaining the building and maintaining the dykes so the democracy arises not from some abstract ideal but from purely pragmatic concerns and that's a useful model to use going forward as we're facing issues that are literally global scale and can't be pinned down to a single person a single area a single country but are actually fully global so we need a democracy that focuses on the pragmatics rather than the arbitrary ideals and ideologies
