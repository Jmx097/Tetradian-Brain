one of the corollary to the scan frame is a cross-reference between complexity and skill level required to do the work skill and effect is is an ability to address variants to address uniqueness to address uncertainty so when we look at scan its focus is on mapping over the relationships between certainty versus uncertainty and time from a given now before and after so when we look at skill there are four quite distinct skill levels that map quite closely to the scan domains of simple complicated ambiguous not known the first level is the trainee the training really is not expecting to deal with any amount of uncertainty they're gonna follow instructions and really nothing else at all they've got to follow a very simple step-by-step rules if we look at McDonald's for example they minimize the training because everything has a rule book to work directly with it they can run most of the business on trainees at the next level which actually maps to the complicated domain we've got the apprentice the apprentice is someone who has some level of knowledge they are it's a low skill but they're not working at the action they're learning about the thing about the theory of the business rather than the practice they're going to go down to becoming a trainee again when they're running at front line they need detailed supervision still and they're working on an extended version of rules rather than the very simple ones they're able to create some of their own rules to adapt for their own needs but they're not really able to do things on their own the next level is a journeyman which we might describe the classic journeyman which is a some others it's a bachelor's level they're expected to be able to sort out uncertainty but they don't have to do it they're able to do experiments the focus there is on experiment two rather than evaluate which is over here so very much focused on that they are they are dealing with uncertainty that focuses on things like patterns and that's what we work with at that stage of the development of skill they still have a certain amount of supervision but they're expected to be able to sort out most practical issues on their own at some point and this is where the classic phrase masterpiece comes from they have to be able to prove that they can do it all on their own and they can solve a technical or whatever problem entirely on their own without supervision that's when they become the master and again we move down from the ambiguous down to the knot now they can deal with not known that's where the skill resides and is most applied it's a high skill it's working at the point of action but it's very much principles-based they've got all the others on call but they can call our principals to do with deep uncertainty so weekly map the tasks as they built the level of task notice we move away from the real-time into a distance but less low certainty so high certainty Louis doesn't he's still but still away from there and then back to the front line so this gives us a map of the skill levels that we need but notice there's a track here which we'll see in the next video about what happens when we move away from run to run time where everything gets compressed so that we only have real time what happens to those two middle skill levels but we can use the scan itself to map out what the likely requirements are which in turn will tell us what the skills that we need are likely to be the skill levels we need are likely to be but notice that track will see the status of other traps when we look at the net in the next video thanks for watching do look at the youtube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos on the tools themselves
