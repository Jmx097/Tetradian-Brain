for enterprise architecture one of our core concerns is how our architecture is going to support design for failure the fact that things are going to fail one of my real concerns about the wave a lot of enterprise architecture is done at present is that it seems to design only for a happy path where everything is going to work this is particularly important if we are over reliant on IT we need to understand what are our processes for business continuity and disaster recovery when the IT goes down first one is we need to identify at least the namib all sources of failure but remember also that unknown unknowns always exist a simple example would be what happens when your IT goes ten feet underwater which is what happened in New York in hurricane sandy what happens when you get a flood what happens when you get a lightning strike that knocks out you the local controller what are the impacts how are you going to prioritize the probability of a risk versus the severity of the impact these are trade-offs that we need to make responding to something where it doesn't matter if it isn't fixed for a day or two is very very different from the complexity and cost of something that has to keep going under all circumstances will be up in a second or two at most we also need a lot of particular business architecture space we need to think very carefully about fungibility of services about how we can substitute one type of service for another and as seamlessly as possible a simple example here is that if your IT system goes down you're likely to use a manual process in the local Starbucks for example the credit machine the cash machine was out of action the credit tilts but it could record they had a cash book a manual cash book when they're out entries in to record all of the the the sales of the day that meant that you not only had to for the cash book to hand but also the mechanisms to capture the information that you put in that book and put them back into the ordinary IT system later when the system's back up what are the overrides that you're going to need to do for that so firstly you've got the fungibility of services that were able to replace an IT system with a manual system so we need to model it as if it's an application not as if it's something completely different at a completely different layer of the architecture they have to be considered to be symmetrical the same thing we've also got to look at how we're going to recover from that situation how are we going to build the continuity in there so in our architecture we need to design for failure rather than simply assume that it won't happen
