continuing on with this work on power in enterprise architecture 1 another thing we can look at is the relationship between power and responsibility now power is about the ability to do work one of the things we need to look at is what are the forms of work the dimensions of work now if you remember the earlier video about asset dimensions we work on assets so the same dimension and supply there is physical work physically changing something there is virtual work often mental effort of moving things and moving virtual things around shape making changes to virtual entities there is emotional or relational work building relationships with other people and maintaining those those relationships and there is aspirational work goals you might call it spiritual work if you like a sense of me creating a sense of meaning and purpose a sense of self and a relationship with that which is greater than self hence an organization which is all about relationship with something greater than self needs to have the work done about building that that kind of the power needed to build that kind of work now machines can only do physical work and virtual work working on data for example create read update delete all that kind of stuff they're not they can't do relational work as such and this certainly don't do purposive work so if we need those other two forms of work the relational work on the aspirational work that can only be done by people so if we try to build a system that expects everything to be done by machine it's not going to work the ability to do the work is not going to be there but there's also a very tight relationship between power and responsibility I can frame that specifically as a response ability the ability to choose appropriate responses so Rossi for example responsible accountable consulted informed or engaged those are standard models that we use right the through mainstream business but think of them always in terms of what is the power what is the ability to do the work that we're asking for in each of those relationships now the same applies in relationships between your services to some extent it applies the same between machines as with humans but what is the ability to do work what is the tendency to avoid work and think that power is the ability to avoid or offload the work to dump it on other people the same is true for example for an IT system or a technical system where you have one system that runs open-loop and assumes that certainly other systems are going to sort out the resultant mess this is a classic power problem that is really useful to think of it in terms of power and responsibility so power is the ability to do the work we need an emphasis on the ability perhaps but also an emphasis on the response ability the to the context
