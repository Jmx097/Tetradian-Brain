one of the most common phrases I come across when any in any discussions around this coronavirus and beyond it's the phrase when we get back to normal but the question never seems to be asked about what exactly is normal what is comfortable for some people that's considered normal is actually extremely uncomfortable for others so do we really want to go back to that what it would be normal if we talked about going forward to a normal rather than bad a useful point to remember is that in geometry normal literally means 90 degrees on to something else it's that's normal that burn that relationship is a 90-degree angle so often I think of what's considered to be normal is actually sideways on from reality completely sideways on with no connection at all there are huge issues that are not being addressed in the so-called current normal and in reality what's normal is just a mix of habit and wishful thinking in terms of the sins of dubious discipline which is in another video we discussed elsewhere it's essentially what we call the golden age game but a refusal to face the present by looking only in the past or only in the future there's a golden age in either so in either direction but to get to either of those we've got to do some action now so normal is often a way of avoiding actually facing what has to be done right now again as in the previous video we talked about belief that when belief when action starts what assumption starts with I know the one thing we know we're in were in a high level of change is that we don't know the how there is by definition something that we don't know we have to deal with all of the unknown unknown all of the unknowns generally identify what we do and don't know and be honest about it if we cling to belief we won't have the ability to sense what's actually going on so a useful question here is what kind of normal do we actually want often normal is actually essentially a feeling rather than an action a state one thing in fact normal is not in a dynamic environment normal it's not a state things are changing all the time but particularly what's happening now is we're dealing with major change in climate in terms of health systems in terms of International Economics logistics in terms of politics of much much more there is no normal to go back to we can only go for which to something which we've much more dynamic and to get there we need to get clear on what is the vision what are we actually trying to do what are the signals that will happen when we are in normal so that we can keep adapting continuing towards that normal there is because that vision then gives us values which are tests or ways we can look at it and principles which are actual identify us it looks more like this it looks more like that these guide are actual decisions in terms of to going towards or away from something that we would describe as normal but again it's going to be dynamic so some of classic themes of a comfortable norm would be the whole of the Maslow set things like enough food enough some kind of relationship that actually works some kind of sense of peace or the comfort within ourselves again dynamic not static actualization a sense of meaning and purpose a sense of I fit within this world I have a place so when we go into an organization and apply that same thinking what would normal be within that organization a very simple example that's changed for a lot of people particularly in my kind of space where I'm able to quotes work from home a lot of people aren't but now I'm able to work from home it's become of a new normal so what aspects of that actually work what work what don't work that noon all has a lot of isolation a literal sense of literal no longer being in touch with the world what do we need to do to make that work to bring those elements together to adapt continuously any organizations particularly a useful approach is to say there is now what how do we get to the next bit of new when we get there continually test that's a when we get to that new that's I knew now now goes to the new now goes to the new now goes to the new so continually adapt continually transform continually work so that normal is something that is dynamic rather than static that's the architectures that we need is something that supports that rather than something that is fixed because if something's fixed it'll already be out of date by the time things have changed
