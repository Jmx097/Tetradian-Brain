another theme that's come up recently particulars people get more fed up into the coronavirus lockdown is some interesting questions about of rights what exactly do we mean when we talk about rights the in some ways it's some of the protests and concerns from an outside perspective at least look almost laughable the demand to have the right to go anywhere to do as we please to have freedom these are made almost laughable when we look at the virus the virus doesn't care it's going to kill you anyway or kill someone particularly when you may not have any symptoms but you're busy affecting someone literally infecting or killing someone else these start to cause some very real questions and the idea of rights as an absolute as personal start really getting in the way of human survival in this case what does freedom actually minton in a pandemic these are things that only makes sense in a social context they certainly don't make one in a health or medical context these are much more complex issues that they're presented to be in effect what was the only thing we know is that survival depends on everyone's responsibility not arbitrary rights so it's worthwhile to look again that the concept of rights has some really gaping floors that are not helping in terms of literal human survival in this case a right is really a declaration of a design outcome without any indication but how the heck going to get to that outcome it's often to absolute look at right away for example when p2 people have the same right away at the same moment there's no solution other than my T's right it doesn't help but too often we get the idea that I have rights you have responsibilities this becomes rather questionable particularly when rights are those kind of rights are embedded in a social structure where someone is arbitrarily given privilege that really priority in the law over someone else in a hierarchy in a business hierarchy far too often the superior has rights over the the sister the employees the subsidiary people under that person's drive as opposed to seeing it as a mutual set of interlocking responsibilities the so-called manager is actually a support function sideways on not above so we really do need to reframe the whole concept of rights in terms not of an arbitrary declaration of outcome but how the heck we get there and the way we get there is through mutual interlocking responsibilities what are the responsibilities that make this possible right for example in Finland I gather there's a legal right to high-speed broadband how's that going to happen but the only way we can make sense of it is by looking at what are the responsibilities who has those responsibilities and what are the interlocks that make it fair within a functional society so whenever we look at rights we need to be looking at that what are the responsibilities and what are the mutuality what are the interlocks that make it work so for enterprise architects even within our own organizations there are many rights like The Situation's going on rights of property rights of possession those kind of things rights of control all of those issues arise we can let's start testing all those issues now about shifting from a rights-based approach to a responsibilities proper based approach we can start looking at those now because as we move on move forward from coronavirus those issues are going to have to have reworked and rethought at a fully global scale that's what it's going to require us when we start looking at rights and responsibilities in order to move forward from where we have
