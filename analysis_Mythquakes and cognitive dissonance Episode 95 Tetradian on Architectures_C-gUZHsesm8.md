# Analysis: Mythquakes and cognitive dissonance: Episode 95, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video distinguishes **mythquakes** from cognitive dissonance, defining mythquakes as significant collisions between unexamined assumptions (myths) and reality that produce life-changing impacts, unlike cognitive dissonance which merely describes the mismatch without addressing consequences or remedies. The speaker introduces a measurement scale for mythquakes based on the number of lives affected and outlines a structured approach for preparation, management, and recovery. This concept is demonstrated through the viewer's question itself as a mini mythquake.

## Key Takeaways
- **Mythquake definition**: Arises when a misplaced assumption collides with reality, with significance determined by life-changing effects on individuals or groups, unlike cognitive dissonance which only notes the mismatch mechanism.
- **Mythquake scale**: Exponential, logarithmic in powers of 10—from 10^0 (one person's life changed) to 10^9 (extinction-level events like those "on the horizon").
- **Differences from cognitive dissonance**: Mythquakes emphasize impact, causes beyond dissonance (e.g., habit without thinking), and provide actionable structures; cognitive dissonance is a "tangled, elitist" term without guidance on remedies.
- **Mythquake process**: Involves before (identification, mitigation, preparedness), during (panic control, triage, guiding principles), and after (recovery, learning).
- **Terminology advantage**: "Mythquake" is direct, memorable, and analogous to earthquakes (tension buildup from ignored stresses), unlike the cumbersome "cognitive dissonance."
- **Real-world examples**: Applies to enterprise architecture myths (e.g., it's only about IT) and personal mismatches (e.g., assuming easy travel to Australia).

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Before a mythquake**: Identify potential mismatches by questioning unexamined assumptions; mitigate risks and build preparedness.
- **During a mythquake**: Maintain calm with guiding principles, perform triage to prioritize responses.
- **After a mythquake**: Focus on recovery and learning—avoid jumping to quick assumptions or obvious comparisons without depth; verify assumptions systematically.
- **General advice**: Use mythquake as a framework to access tools and options unavailable under mere cognitive dissonance labeling, preventing small tremors from escalating.

## Quotes
- "A myth quick arises when with an assumption collides with reality a misplaced assumption."
- "Cognitive dissonance itself is only about the fact or the mechanism of a mismatch it doesn't really tell us anything more than that whereas myth quick focuses more on the consequences of the mismatch."
- "It's got life-changing effects that it literally changes someone's life that's when a myth great becomes significant."
- "Don't jump too quickly to assumptions and particularly don't jump to jump to obvious comparisons when you haven't actually looked in any depth of what's going on."
- "No it's not just cognitive dissonance there's more to it than that."
