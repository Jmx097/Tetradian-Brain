in this episode I'd like to tackle a very common mistake or misperception in business architecture particularly about the idea of full profit versus not-for-profit what I'd like to suggest is that we need to rethink this and realize that actually every organization is for profit we need to think more carefully about what we mean by profit exactly as in enterprise architecture which has been dominated by IT centrism a lot of business architecture has been dominated by money centrism and it's every bit as much of a mistake an equally serious mistake the point here is that many thought there are many forms of value and not all of them can or should be framed or converted to monetary form for example look at trust look at satisfaction those are things that can't be converted to monetary form or if we do we usually destroy them and yet we want to have them as things that are returned from these are things of value and creating more of those are profitable in the sense of that value but it's not money we need also to be very clear about some distinctions between price and value worth and cost value in essence is in the services that can be delivered for example the house for a long time in Britain that had the value of a house had steadily increased for the same price the effective price had remained the same as three times your annual salary but he'd added over a hundred years and added on rooms kitchens bathrooms toilets all the rest of it larger spaces central heating double glazing all of these were added on to the value of the house and in recent years the last 20 years the actual value has been dropping in terms of the services whilst the price has been increasing there's an interesting question there another is about worth worth resides more in what it means to us there's this the crucial distinction between a house and a home it's worth it because it is our home it has meaning for us the cost is the sum of all the effort needed to create it which in many cases is much more than just the price the money it isn't just the money that we made for it but the sweat and tears that went into building their house into the commitment into the choices that made their house what it is and the price what's a price well a price is evaluation in monetary terms it's to be blamed to be blunt about it it's a mess price is an almost meaningless term because it's made up of all sorts of non-trans transferable not reversible transforms so trying to build everything on money and price is not actually a good idea the real question is what is the value that drives this what are the values the services they're worth the cost that drive this and then look at profit in those terms once we realize that then we realize that actually every organisation is for profit what we need to do is get better at producing the profit that we need
