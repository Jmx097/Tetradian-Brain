another challenge that's come up for me personally during this pandemic but actually more general it's a question of digital legacy how do we protect our digital legacy and make it available to others once we pass on in the business environment this is called escrow we protect whether there's a promise to protect or provide support if the company that's providing the service goes under but it's this whole issue of digital legacy as a reminder to this particularly because a close colleague died last month and a lot of his friends and in fact me as well I'm running around trying to make sure that we protect his legacy before it vanishes thus he scores covered an enormous range over a very large number of years and touched so many different places that it's quite difficult to find where they all are in his case fortunately his family is actively supporting us but in other cases they may not offer maybe no family to support it so we each need personally to think about our own legacy prepare prep planning and preparation for escrow so I've split this into three distinct steps one of them is the stuff that we can do even without active permission which is things like protecting is it mostly short-term stuff particularly particularly things like domain names in the web hosting which can be forgotten or someone can be out of the country and be lost so using a team or a bunch of friends to make sure that there is money available to pay for these things which otherwise risk that parts of that part of the legacy just vanishing I've had web domains that have just died web sites have gone redundant changes in code that make it inaccessible I need to protect this stuff because I've got a lot of material in my case 1,200 Arctic twenty-five books fifty slide decks a hundred and fifty videos already all of these we need to protect somehow because some of it may be very useful to other people in the future so step one is making sure that even if we forget these crucial things that can vanish at a moment's notice if we're not careful that make sure at least those are protected step two it's about disability if we become disabled if we have a stroke for example or a car accident we can be out of action for a long time don't we don't actually die for these we need things like passwords I'm having making sure colleagues friends are trusted to prevent a trusted adviser a trusted agency has things like passwords has things like content backups so that those are available in the event that it goes further and that we can access that material or at least if nothing else that someone can put up a tweet on our behalf and say so-and-so is you know Tommy it's okay he's out of action for now but he's okay and step three arises on the point of death where in other words were someone let me I no longer have a choice about what happens to my legacy or no longer adding to it there are very real issues around things like death certificates there are certain things there are legal requirements and those are really important issues around family for example my colleagues following up on the death of this colleague they do they asked the family for support and the family have indeed given their support but a lot of a crucial agencies like a web hosting agency will not accept someone taking over a domain without a death certificate but to back it up and a death certificate may not be available for some weeks even maybe longer but during which time that that particular asset may be lost so we need to plan for this as well some key questions around digital legacy what are the choices on the legacy what do we choose to share why do we choose who do we understand but it might be useful for how can we let them know that it is still available but will still be available in the point of disability or death there are a whole bunch of so-called intellectual property issues things like one of the issues that we have in enterprise architecture is we have very few good case studies because when Enterprise Architecture is applied people either want to hide the bad ones or that the good ones have worked so well that it's part of the company's secret sauce so there are very real issues about how do we share material which is crucial to the to the development of the discipline but it still under commercial in confidence we need to have the right to access or it means to access those companies that say look can we publish this thing from 20 years ago which even though it's old and no longer relevant to you is seriously important to other people and the other one that we need to watch and we need to respect is the whole family issues there's a lot of issues around privacy I mean the part of my digital legacy would include photographs but they're often include photographs of other people who may not want to be part of that legacy there's privacy issues for family too a lot of the stuff I've written is very private it's very much embarrassed could be embarrassing angry at certain people that I don't really want to have that available oh no I don't want to show those up people up again for disputes that were 20 years ago and also there's an issue around income some of the legacy we have may be financially valuable and may be the only income that our families have it's important to respect and protect that and there's also related to things like big quests so one of the issues that's come up during the pandemic is a more generic one about digital legacy what are we doing to protect our digital legacy because we all have some one of the question planning that we need to do there's three steps about dealing with the short-term dealing with disability to do with death and what are the the challenges that we need to face the questions around what to share and what not what the IP issues are and also the family issues so take your own digital Legacy series because other people will need it even more than you will once you pass off
