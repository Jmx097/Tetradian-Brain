another issue that's been really highlighted in the coronavirus over the last few weeks and months has been how does your own trust but every organization depends on trust I'm often fascinated that organizations don't actually use it as a core metric because without the business without trust we don't have a business so Trust is absolutely cool - how any organization works but but what happens when Trust is lost what happens when we don't know who we can trust who can we trust who can we not trust who trusts us how do they trust us why do they trust us why do they not trust us these are absolutely core issues that have been highlighted recently but are actually essential to every organization anyway what again coronavirus has highlighted the problems here there's been a loss of trust on provision of fact versus fake news one might say there's a real of concerns about honesty a grilll concern about whether certain people particularly and telling even telling us the truth at all certain governments have we know have been questionable in the way that they've handled the actual factual information so the most of trusting government's a lot of trust in experts a lot of trusting even fact itself one of the postmodern things is that there is no such thing as fact one things that we need to look at is what actually is fact and what is not these are really important questions why do we lose trust how do we lose trust how do we rebuild trust because again without it we don't have any kind of business if there's a lot of trust particularly in intentions that certain politicians would say or certain businesses certain governments and organizations have had that are very different or shown to be very different from what they're actually saying in public the same issues apply just in a routine issue when say your aircraft is delayed the one thing that people want is accurate information it's at least honest information just floundering around with no information at all gives us an immediate loss of trust faith in the world as a whole so how could we do to rebuild trust what I call changes here are things like there's deep uncertainty we have no certainty about certain key issues in coronavirus we can find the factual information but it's weeks late months late because of the lag time a leave time of the infection itself where there's no information when we don't have the information about who has the disease how what even what it's transmissibility is we don't have the language to track when we've got people cut when the disease takes seven to ten days to even begin to show and we have no means to identify whether that's the case and work with that person has been in that time then we simply don't have the information that we can trust another one is that how can we rebuild honesty and transparency because without that we will guarantee the loss of trust and therefore people will not cooperate people will only cooperate when they trust the outcomes when they trust the intentions when they trust the motives so it's a useful issue for enterprise architects and business architects to explore because these issues around trust apply anyway in any organization we can use what we see about how people start to rebuild trust to make sure that our own organizations can be trusted to
