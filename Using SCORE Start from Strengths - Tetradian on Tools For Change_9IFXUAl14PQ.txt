this is part of a series about score a simple framework we can use you can scroll on a whiteboard or whatever to work on strategic issues on any kind of working out what your choices are what the issues are going on very simply it's about what are our capabilities what are the things that we need to work on what are the opportunities and risks that we see in the outside world what is the real world telling us and what are us a criteria for success now one of the challenges with score that people often asks is where do we start in this case we've got we've started with a statement about we've added 3d printing to our to our business what can we do with it and our success criteria value for money keep disruptions to a minimum we want versatility our business needs to be responsive to customer needs so if we've added 3d printing we've added a capability which suggests we would start from from strengths so we've said we've got 3d printing as our new capability where does this take us well there are all sorts of opportunities that we can see now notice we're drawing lines well this isn't just making lists well using it to help us build an idea of what's going on well you mark it but how would that work in terms of disrupting our existing market would that cause trouble can we deal with the challenges that come from disrupting our market what would our markets sir existing markets say what is our response from the market so we're building trails like this there's a customization for existing customers special purpose which would fit very well with versatility uncertainty for responsiveness to customer needs so we need to find out from our customers whether this is something that they want we need to look for those responses on the basis of those responses sponses what do we need to change as we change something as we chat as we add a new capability that then becomes a new capability so thee for example videos on how to set up for 3d printing on a new market these will have different they will have different requirements for those markets we might build another trail for if we have difficulty making sense of how do we add it to our existing to existing product production line which is a challenge here about disruption and possible value for money so we're following the trails just notice where each trail takes you what are we looking for well if we work out how to add it to our to our production line that then will give us our capability to show other people which produces new opportunities again again we're going to be looking for that for the responses from the market which will which will tell us what's going on here and whether there are new challenges we have to face so we follow the trails around it isn't leading to a particular answer the most important part in all of this is finding the right questions once we find the right questions the answers we need will fall straight out that's how you'd use score for when you start from strengths thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
