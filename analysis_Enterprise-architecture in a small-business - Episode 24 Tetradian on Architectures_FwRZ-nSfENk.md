# Analysis: Enterprise-architecture in a small-business - Episode 24, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video outlines a budget-free approach to enterprise architecture (EA) for small businesses, emphasizing four key themes: identifying the broader shared enterprise, aligning with its vision and values, ensuring organizational elements work together purposefully, and building maturity step-by-step. This outside-in method positions the business within a larger context to guide decision-making and foster cohesion without formal tools or costs. It draws on examples like TED to illustrate practical application.

## Key Takeaways
- **Identify the shared enterprise**: Clarify the business by summarizing shared-space concerns (what everyone cares about), activities (what everyone is doing), and importance (why it matters), using three words to define the core enterprise, as in TED's "ideas worth spreading."[Transcript]
- **Align with vision and values**: Position the business relative to the shared enterprise's vision (e.g., TED's technology, entertainment, design) and values (e.g., inspiring, entertaining, ideas that matter) to inform all decision-making.[Transcript]
- **Things work better when they work together on purpose**: Map organizational elements (what they are, how they relate) and align them intentionally with the broader enterprise for better cohesion.[Transcript]
- **Build maturity progressively**: Start with identifying the business and cleaning up current messes; advance to a "pool model" for engaging partners/people, working dynamically with chaos, ensuring reworks maintain purposeful integration.[Transcript]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Step 1: Define your shared enterprise** – Ask: What concerns unite the space? What is everyone doing? Why does it matter? Summarize in three words to form your business architecture foundation.[Transcript]
- **Step 2: Articulate vision/values** – Identify drivers like inspiration or curation; use them to evaluate every business activity (e.g., must it be entertaining and enlightening?).[Transcript]
- **Step 3: Map internal relations** – List "things" in your organization (assets, processes); diagram relations and adjust for purposeful alignment with external vision.[Transcript]
- **Step 4: Advance maturity** – Clean up disengaged/messy elements during reworks; build outward to a "pool model" story that attracts partners/people; iterate to handle chaos dynamically.[Transcript]
