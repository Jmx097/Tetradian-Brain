# Analysis: Interview: Annika Klyver - Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
Annika Klyver discusses the Milky Way framework as a map-making analogy to simplify enterprise architecture, enabling shared sense-making of complex business landscapes. It starts with internal value flows and capabilities but expands to include customer journeys and external ecosystems for holistic enterprise design.[1][2][5]

## Key Takeaways
- The Milky Way framework uses a galaxy/map analogy to create a shared mental model, making abstract architecture accessible beyond traditional models.[1][2]
- It positions value flows (e.g., Plan, Build, Market, Deliver, Learn) with customer journeys on the outer circle, capabilities in the middle, and purposes/goals in the center.[1][2]
- The framework bridges internal views (capabilities, systems, information) with external ones (customer journeys, products, value streams, supply chains) for comprehensive enterprise mapping.[1][5]
- It supports overlays like organization structures, architecture views, and information flows to analyze alignment between operations, goals, and customer needs.[1][2]
- A book by Klyver's colleague (available in English) details the framework, emphasizing practical, immediately usable tools for enterprise design.[2][5]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
The Milky Way Map can be created in seven steps:
- Identify main steps in the value flow.
- Make rough divisions within sectors.
- Capture capabilities, IT systems, and information flows.
- Integrate and gain acceptance.
- Follow the value flow.
- Review the map.
- Add explanatory information.[2]

It integrates with other maps (e.g., Purpose Map, Capability Map, Organisation Map) and supports views like organization overlays or data flows for analysis.[1][2]

## Quotes
- "The backbone of the Milky Way's actually try to get the way of sense making and making people understand this super abstract and complex area of architecture."[Transcript]
- "Once you have that stable ground on the shared knowledge then you can do this assigned opponent instead of trying to figure out what you're designing who's designing and how."[Transcript]
- "We need to add customer journeys product value students and so on two nuts that you can actually have a map that is relevant for the entire scope."[Transcript]
- "There's a huge need for the method that could sense make all this that's where we again we connect design yeah is that all these different views and different ways of working."[Transcript]
