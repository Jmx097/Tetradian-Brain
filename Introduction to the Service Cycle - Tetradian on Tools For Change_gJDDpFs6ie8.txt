what are the stages of service delivery what's the service cycle a complete cycle of a transaction we've got this simple pattern here to explore help us explore what happens in services and service delivery it's actually the same kind of pattern is in the five element sequence that we're seeing elsewhere but it's there's more detail here more subsections within the completions phase so here's the overall pattern each step of the pan is supported by distinct services marketing sales delivery accounts customer service and so on the first step is that we look at shared purpose we establish a common enterprise a common story that context the kind of shared reason to connection interact with each other at all the next one is the week start to make a connection often a personal connection but we also narrow it down to a scope for action and the beginnings of some kind of policies around which any kind of transaction will be built the kind of personal questions of who are you do we trust each other enough to proceed actually applies to both human and machine alike the next step is we agree on a plan for action we built up a conversation but also a contract this settles the details of what will be exchanged in each duration information services products payments whatever we're then set up the transaction itself but this is going to be the content for the transaction or interaction and that depends on all of the previous stages it's really important that we don't over focus on this stage we then actually do the prod delivery of product or service now this is what we would map out in the fine detail of conventional process modeling but notice that it's always in context with everything that's happened before we now come to the completions and each one of these wraps back and matches back to the previous step so several sub stages here which the first is just simply to to ensure that there's an actual end to an endpoint to the delivery of the service or product we're now complete for the for the perspective of the provider we complete the contract in a commercial context typically a failure occurs when the customer or consumer pays four pays for the service pays the supplier or the provider the next step is that we complete from the other side of the story we're completing the relationship making sure that the relationship is sorted out again the completion here make often occur sometime after the completion of the action itself for example bought food is eaten and finally we can complete from the perspective of the story the shared purpose the enterprise for long term viability all of these interactions must be seen as fair and balanced not just by the trans actors but by all of the players in that shared space so so far this has been a little bit abstract so let's make it come alive and we add the human dimension with some simple minifigures so a simple transaction example we've got a service provider on one side a service consumer on the other first part of this is we establishing an initial connection typically this is done by reputation or brand but we build a connection that's about the broader story the promises that we each make to the story itself we then establish a kind of personal connection which also provides basis for the rules and for the interaction we're also narrowing down word from the big picture to ace more specific scope for action we then start working on something like a contract we specify and agree the details of what the agreement will be about what's going to happen and we often typically do this with a literal handshake we're now set up do the setup for the transaction itself we take action to make the agreed plan happen and we then get the transaction to happen but notice that the people who do the work who actually deliver it the actors which are maybe human or machine in this case humans the ones who do the actual work may not be the ones who had specified the interaction we're then going to establish that the work is complete we've completed the terms of the contract typically we're going to now involve someone like an Accounts Department to deliver the services for the support services for interrupt for completion and notice too that the completion is made it different for each of the players so example here the customers got to satisfy their customer the customers customer and it's always about the whole enterprise the kind of the satisfying those that support the whole story it's always about the overall shared story not just the promises made to each other but tying to the story itself and every stakeholder is watching every stakeholder in that story there's a previous mood video we talked about the holomap about how to identify the full set of stakeholders this really matters here now a really important warning don't try to shortcut that sequence or cycle there's a very common broken version of the cycle which we call the prick quick profit cycle you grab a contract you transact you completely brother next contract you transact your complete and you lose the purpose the connection with people the connection to the story you lose the connection to values to trust to policies it all falls apart all of a sudden without any apparent warning so here's the quick profit trap literally we go from to contract to transaction to doing it to completing to satisfy getting satisfied from the providers perspective owner only and ignore everyone else now this looks like it gets better results in the short term by focusing only on our needs but doing so we greatly risk long-term Roberti so if we focus only on self and on ignoring others in comes out comes we will awaken at very angry regulators we will get hit quite hard or apparently without warning and remember all of this is in full view of all stakeholders so it's a really quick the short this quick profit cycle is a really quick way to create a lot of anti clients of people who are committed against our organization and remember everyone is watching so overall that the cycle that occurs every time we do a service delivery or transaction for products or services that's the overall pattern and that's the service cycle use this to help us look at how our interactions and transactions work thanks for watching do look at the youtube description for links to
