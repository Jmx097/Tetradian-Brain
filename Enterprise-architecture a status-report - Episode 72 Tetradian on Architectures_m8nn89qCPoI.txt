for this on the next couple of episodes I'd like to do a brief series on the current status of Enterprise Architecture where it is a present where it's going or needs to go and where it frankly needs to be within about a decade from now now for the present most of it is to IT centric this is where most people still work though we started my group started moving out of this ten or more years ago but most people still work in this space we're still IT centric it's still dominated by toga it's dominated by the idea that the only things we need to look at our business were business is essentially anything not IT that might affect IT Vendetta applications and technology and where the real focus is on IT infrastructure that's where TOGAF came from and frankly that's where it's still focused anything else that it tries to build on top doesn't really work because it's the actual structure of it is designed for IT infrastructure but so most of the focus then is the idea of that enterprise architecture is business IT alignment and we you can see things like TOGAF is a verb we will talk if your organization is what someone had said it's not really up to the enterprise architecture needs even of the present let alone the future for example it must big IT which is what those frameworks were built for it's now in client cloud data centers it's not within organizations when we look at things like Internet of Things the data and the application of the technology are all mixed up together they're the same thing when we look at things like gdpr or security there is much about people as they are about IT and we have to get the balance right well we don't over focus on one or the other but we essentially get the balance together so we have enterprise architecture frameworks that are hopelessly out of date now and almost perfectly unsuited for the real needs that were starting to face we'll also got a real risk that that kind of enterprise architecture particularly the idea of the enterprise architecture police is becoming completely irrelevant and very much unwanted we have an urgent need for a rebuild and a completely new approach to how we do enterprise architecture that's our status at the present
