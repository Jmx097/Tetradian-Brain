# Analysis: Enterprise architecture and coronavirus: Information: Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The speaker shares personal experiences of confusion and conflicting COVID-19 information during travel from Perth to Melbourne, emphasizing how disasters highlight gaps in accessible, reliable information. From an enterprise architecture viewpoint, organizations must map information needs at crisis points, adapt rigid rules for edge cases, and implement practical measures like social distancing. The talk stresses proactive planning to ensure information availability when standard processes fail.[1]

## Key Takeaways
- Disasters like COVID-19 expose issues with **confusing, misleading, or conflicting information**, such as varying rules between airports, leaving travelers without guidance on masks or quarantine.[1]
- Enterprise architecture should identify **information needs at each crisis stage**, especially for those who "fall through the cracks" of rigid rules, like international movers without local homes.[1]
- Practical adaptations work well, such as hotels switching from buffets to staff-handled meals with tick-box orders and social distancing to reduce infection risks.[1]
- Long-term preparation includes sharing **access credentials and passwords** with trusted colleagues to preserve digital legacy and ensure continuity if individuals are incapacitated.[1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Map **information requirements** in enterprise architecture: For each scenario where things go wrong, define what information people need, how to deliver it, and contingencies for non-standard cases (e.g., no home address for quarantine).[1]
- Implement **practical crisis adaptations**: Replace self-service buffets with staff-only handling, use tick-box ordering for meals, and enforce spacing for social distancing to minimize infection paths.[1]
- Plan **digital legacy access**: Share access numbers, passwords, and backups with trusted colleagues or teams to maintain availability of critical information during personal crises like illness or travel disruptions.[1]

## Quotes
- "the information we had was confusing misleading so much so that for example the person who'd offered to let me stay at their house realize that the new of the new information they couldn't do it so completely confusing information"[1]
- "from an enterprise architecture perspective what information to people need at each point what is the information they likely to need when things go wrong that's the thing we need to look at"[1]
- "what is it the falls between the cracks what happens to the people who don't fit the standard expectations who don't in my cases for example have a home to go to"[1]
- "our best grow for the longer term so that various colleagues have my access numbers and my passwords so that if I don't make it through this mess then at least you will still have the information that I have available"[1]
