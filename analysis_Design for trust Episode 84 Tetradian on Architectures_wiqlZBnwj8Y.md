# Analysis: Design for trust: Episode 84, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
Trust is the foundational asset for any organization, surpassing even financials in importance, and without it, business cannot exist. The video explains how to design trust into enterprise architecture by aligning actions to values derived from the enterprise story, turning them into testable principles and pervasive services. It critiques one-sided terms and conditions, advocating for mutual "trusts and commitments" instead.[1]

## Key Takeaways
- **Trust as core metric**: Trust is the essential asset for business survival, more critical than financials or other factors.
- **Source of trust**: Trust emerges from alignment to values proven through actions, with values originating from the enterprise's story.
- **Examples of values**: Includes ethics, safety, sustainability, financial honesty, and fairness, which must permeate the entire enterprise.
- **Architectural integration**: Values become actionable principles with tests, supported by pervasive services like health and safety as everyone's responsibility.
- **Critique of terms and conditions**: Modern digital terms are often unconscionable, one-sided, and legally invalid; replace with mutual trusts and commitments to customers, suppliers, and community.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Identify values from the enterprise story (e.g., ethics, safety, sustainability, honesty, fairness).
- Convert values into **actionable principles** with associated tests to verify alignment across the organization.
- Build **pervasive services** in architecture to support values, such as structures ensuring health and safety is everyone's responsibility.
- Redesign terms and conditions as **trusts and commitments**: Explicitly commit to actions that build trust with customers, suppliers, and the community, avoiding hidden, one-sided clauses that claim undue rights (e.g., ownership of user content).
