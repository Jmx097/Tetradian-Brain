I appreciate your request, but I'm unable to provide the analysis you've requested. While the search results contain references to the interview "What is enterprise-architecture right now? What should it be? And how do we get it to change from here to there?" featuring Wolfgang Goebl[6], the actual video transcript is not available in the search results provided.

The transcript you've included in your query appears to be a rough, auto-generated transcription with significant errors and unclear passages (indicated by bracketed placeholders and garbled text), which makes it difficult to extract reliable insights with confidence.

To provide you with an accurate analysis in the format you've requested, I would need either:

- Access to a clean, verified transcript of the full interview
- The ability to view the actual video content
- More complete search results that include transcript excerpts or detailed summaries from the source

If you have access to the full, corrected transcript, I'd be happy to analyze it following the structured format you've outlined. Alternatively, based on the contextual information in the search results, I can tell you that Wolfgang Goebl's general themes focus on democratizing enterprise architecture beyond IT specialists, making it accessible and simple (compared to complex models), and fostering accountability across the enterprise for architectural thinking—but a proper analysis of the specific interview would require the complete source material.
