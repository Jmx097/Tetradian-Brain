Alec Blair asks how we can use Enterprise Architecture as a silo Buster he comments that in my organization we end up connecting the dots for our clinical and business areas in ways that they would have difficulty to see otherwise well there's a core principle here where I strongly agree about the need to connect there's a the tagline of things work better when they work together on purpose all of our work is about connecting keeping things on purpose keeping things infective but there's a twist here we really need to watch was that which is that we need to understand that we must bridge the silos not attempt to break them this is because silos arise naturally from jargon from perspective from the different views that each group has from the different histories that each group has each specialism each discipline has its own history its own jargon so we need to bridge between them if we try to break them will actually break the organization which is not a good idea so we can use tools like V PEC T which I mentioned in a previous episode V pick T values policies events content and trust to map what the possible clashes are and find ways to bridge between them group to group and slowly carefully across the whole the other one is that the role of an Enterprise Architect depends on trust if we try to impose anything on people we'll lose that trust we really need to see that our work at the enterprise level at the enterprise architecture level is very political it has to be very in person but it takes a long time to build the social network that we need to build that trust so we need to build in-person relations to build to build connections to know who to connect to who across the whole space we're building bridges between the silos we're not trying to break them
