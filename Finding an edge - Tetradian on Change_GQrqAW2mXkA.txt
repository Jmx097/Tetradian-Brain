there's a subtle yet really important issue around perception and particularly perception of edges human perception is really good at finding edges and working with edges the sharper the edge the better it is one of the reasons why people love binary decisions yes no true false political ones like left versus right these are you know me versus we um these are easy binary edges that we can tell but the real world often has a much more scalar a subtle view of edges and sometimes when there are no edges we can't see them particularly when those edges are very slow moving for example population changes are subtle they're taking place over long periods of time there's a huge difference for example between weather which has lots of veggies in fact it's almost defined as having ages there is a change from one to another versus climate which is much slower change but much more inexorable we can't adapt to climate change in the way that we can adapt so easily to weather because when climate change happens we can't sense it in the real in the real time and so all of our mechanisms for working with change don't work so we need to find some kind of edge and one of the ways we do that is by manufacturing edges think of an extreme case of a white out of a a situation where you're in a snow storm and there is nothing but white people go crazy under those circumstances because there's no age at all so what we do is we introduce an edge such as a value a feeling something that will guide feelings rather than beliefs that we produce something around which change can coalesce when something matches that edge that value we can say that's the direction we want to go in in the midst of the turmoil in the midst of all the possibilities we have an edge that we can work with if we don't have edges of that kind edges that are based on values it's very difficult to work with very large scale very slow moving change so what are the values that matter to you what are the human values that pretty much everyone shares there are a few of them fairness for example is a classic one so what are these edges that support working with very large scale change look for them because those are the ones that we're going to need as we move forward into absolutely vast change
