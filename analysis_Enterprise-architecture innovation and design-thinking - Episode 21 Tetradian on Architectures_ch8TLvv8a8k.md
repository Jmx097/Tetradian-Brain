# Analysis: Enterprise-architecture, innovation and design-thinking - Episode 21, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video explores the integration of enterprise architecture, innovation, and design thinking, emphasizing design thinking's handling of inherent uncertainty through iterative processes like the "squiggle" and a focus on framing the right question rather than forcing solutions. Enterprise architecture supports this by driving toward execution, with TOGAF as a viable framework when applied beyond IT assumptions. Success requires treating these as skills honed through safe failure and practice, not rigid steps.

## Key Takeaways
- Design thinking addresses **inherent uncertainty** in early project stages via the "squiggle" (chaotic exploration settling into clarity), iteration, and bouncing between ambiguity and real-world validation.[6]
- Shift focus from solutions to **finding the right question**, as proper framing allows answers to emerge naturally.[6]
- Enterprise architecture integrates with design thinking by progressing from exploration to implementation, exemplified by **TOGAF's phases** (vision, business architecture, implementation, learning loops) when not limited to IT.[6]
- These are **skills, not step-by-step methods**, requiring practice, safe failure ("fail, to learn"), and iterative looping back to chaos.[6]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Embrace the **squiggle process**: Start in chaotic uncertainty, iterate through exploration and validation, hopping between ambiguity and definite plans toward implementation; expect loops back to chaos post-"done".[6]
- Use **iterative integration** like TOGAF: Follow phases—initial vision/exploration, business architecture planning, implementation, and learning loops—for full cycles beyond IT-only assumptions.[6]
- Prioritize **safe failure**: Create environments to "fail, to learn" through practice, avoiding book-only approaches; treat as skill-building via repeated wrong attempts.[6]
- Frame problems by **seeking the right question** first in innovation, dipping into the unknown iteratively rather than forcing fits.[6]

## Quotes
- "Design Thinking is a very blurry and much misused term but... it's about inherent uncertainty we don't know what's going to happen."[6]
- "The focus is on finding the right question because when we find the right way to frame what the real question is it seems like the answer that we need kind of falls out on its own quite naturally."[6]
- "It's a skill it's definitely a skill it's not something which you can just get out of a book you can only do it by practice and practice means getting it wrong quite a bit of the time so we have to make it safe to fail that's why people often talk about fail to learn."[6]
- "One way to look at the integration of this is TOGAF done right... if we remove the assumption about that it's only about IT it's actually quite a good method for following design thinking processes."[6]
