in a previous video which I'll link to above we talked about the holomap a tool which helps us map out the stakeholders in an enterprise and their relationships with each other for the first level for the use of holomap one of several uses of it we started start out by mapping out just the content of the enterprise starting with the enterprise itself anyone who's familiar with enterprise architecture might recognize this as just being straightforward Zachman modeling so let's start with just the the nature of the enterprise and for this one I'll use the TED conferences whose very simple vision or course as core idea is ideas worth spreading we call that the enterprise vision which again we've talked about on a previous video that I'll link to above what is the is everyone concerned about what is everyone doing with what we're concerned about and why is it important that we're doing what we're doing because these are ideas that are worth spreading so we'll then take a straightforward list which is what are the things what are the processes or the actions the locations the people the events and the decisions and all we do at this stage is just make lists so for example what are the things in an in an enterprise which is focused on ideas worth spreading well the obvious one is ideas which means we need people with ideas we're building a relationship straightaway what we're going to do is to promote ideas it's a conference so we're going to do it at conference venues the things we'll also need are the means to promote which in our case if we look at them there would be things like books cameras which means we're going to need people who can do these things so people to promote people to operate cameras cameras and also things like edit the events are going to be the find the person with an idea the idea person which tells us we're going to need someone who can find us for ideas we're going to present conference the conference itself the presentation of the conference there's going to be the ticket sale a decision we're going to need is is this idea worth spreading we're going to be again presenting the conference we're going to be sell tickets work that means we're going to need tickets and a location is going to be another record location is where we're going to promote promotion point and you'll notice that a lot of these things for example a promotion point might be physical it might be virtual it might be word-of-mouth so there's different ways we can describe the meaning of location so just in this straight away what you've got here is a whole lot of connections between things we've got to find the people with ideas we've got to we've got to check whether the idea is worth presenting we've got to find the idea person we've got the means of promotion which is to promote the to promote the ideas we've got a connection here so we're connecting the things to the actions to the events to the decisions and so on so we've mapped out the core content of the enterprise as a whole what we're now going to do with the holomap they start to map out who does what where when we already know the why because of the ideas worth spreading so each of these becomes also a test everything in the enterprise connects back to this initial vision that's a very first level of a holomap thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
