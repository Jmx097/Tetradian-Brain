# Analysis: Enterprise architecture in miniature - 4: Prototypes - Episode 83, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary

This episode demonstrates how **enterprise architecture principles apply to physical design constraints** by using a van conversion as a case study[3]. The speaker explores how to bridge the gap between architectural scopes and practical design through virtual prototyping, testing feasibility, priorities, and requirements while managing interconnected concerns in a severely space-constrained environment[3].

## Key Takeaways

- **Separation of concerns is critical**: Only one functional use should be visible at a time, preventing the mixing of work spaces (filming, editing, workshops) with living spaces (bed, kitchen)[3]

- **Utilities and resource management are foundational constraints**: Power requirements, water supply, storage capacity, and access all demand careful planning and interconnected solutions[3]

- **Virtual prototyping saves time and resources**: Testing design concepts digitally before physical implementation helps determine feasibility, cost, effort, and actual requirements without expensive real-world trial-and-error[3]

- **Design for change and reuse**: The van structure should accommodate modifications without permanent alterations, allowing flexibility in usage patterns and potential future resale without requiring demolition of custom modifications[3]

- **Everything depends on everything else**: Architecture differs from simple design because it focuses on how all elements interconnect holistically, not just individual components in isolation[3]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials

The speaker presents a **prototyping methodology** for complex constrained environments:

1. **Identify all functional scopes** requiring space (courses, workshops, filming, editing, tool development, living accommodation)

2. **Map constraint categories**: utilities (power, water), storage requirements, access patterns, and cost/time/effort feasibility

3. **Apply separation-of-concerns principle**: Design modular configurations where different uses don't visually or functionally overlap

4. **Use virtual prototypes**: Model configurations digitally to test feasibility before physical implementation

5. **Design for modularity**: Utilize existing structural features (rails, mounting points) to enable reconfiguration without permanent modifications

6. **Test interconnections**: Verify that solving constraints in one area doesn't create problems in another, since "everything depends on everything else"[3]

## Quotes

"we shift now from architecture towards design we want to apply the design criteria the success criteria to the build scope"[3]

"it's expensive to test very expensive to test something out in real all the time we're going to save a lot of effort and time just simply testing with virtual prototypes"[3]

"I want to have separation of concerns such that only one use is visible at a time"[3]

"the point about an architecture is that each of those prototypes codes all about connecting everything to everything else it's not just designing one bit how it works as a whole that's where it becomes architecture as well as designed"[3]
