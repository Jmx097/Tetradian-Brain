so milind winter dennis medic we're at the at your conference in fact at the intersection of nineteen conference does enterprise design it's in lisbon at the academy de Ciencias what is enterprise design how does it differ from enterprise architecture how does it relate with enterprise architecture and how can we get them to work together well thanks for being here tom in this question so so I would say it's most mostly is a different background in the origins are different so enterprise design is coming out of design in the sense of industrial design experience design service designs are designing things for people which is something that we also do in in architecture and I would say that enterprise design borrows a lot of elements from enterprise architecture with that slightly different background and slightly different premise so we look also into where the architecture of the enterprise the operations the processes the systems but we add to that the what you couldn't for the human centric approaches the what is now called business design business models and very importantly the approach of doing design research qualitative quantitative doing prototyping validation and bringing it down to a tangible level so actually having some kind of what we call the rendering so something physical can be that brings these moments of enterprise earnest to life as something that we can actually experience as people while I think enterprise architecture mostly stays in the conceptual realm of mapping and modeling and and structuring the enterprise which is a really really key element so I think we are the only one actually combining that with the design approach to bringing yeah so far we hope that that will change soon yeah so I like a shot now so one image that we usually use that we are basically building the bridge between the product market fit on the one side and the product delivery on the other side and enterprise design helps you with understanding your customer relations on the one side and your operations on the other side and makes it fit into one coherent picture that's great yeah so my experience of it is that it's the structure that very simple framework that you have that I'll patch into the video at this point the it that framework is taking it all the way through from the most abstract down to the concrete and linking across through the design spaces the human oriented spaces but I talk about this I talk about the relationship a new structure and story a lot of the design is really focused on the story I said it means a much more important bridge them how enterprise architecture it becomes so focused on RT and very little else so that's a really important distinction the reason why I'm here at this conference yes I I would I would agree with a but I think we we find a lot of very very valuable thinking and approaches and methods and maps and tools in coming from the enterprise architecture space and we have a lot of practitioners of enterprises and coming out of the enterprise architecture space so I I would agree that we often find it to be limited in practice in many enterprises but on the other hand there's a wealth of knowledge and approaches that that we try to connect to with over that's correct thanks very much both thank you
