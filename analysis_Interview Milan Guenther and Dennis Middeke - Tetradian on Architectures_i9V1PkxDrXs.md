# Analysis: Interview: Milan Guenther and Dennis Middeke - Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
Enterprise design emerges from design disciplines like industrial and service design, borrowing from enterprise architecture while emphasizing human-centric approaches, prototyping, and tangible renderings to bridge customer relations and operations. It complements enterprise architecture's conceptual mapping by adding story-focused, experiential elements for a coherent enterprise picture. The speakers highlight valuable EA tools but note its practical limitations, advocating integration for holistic transformation.[1][2]

## Key Takeaways
- Enterprise design differs from enterprise architecture in origins (design vs. architecture) and focus: it adds human-centric business design, qualitative/quantitative research, prototyping, validation, and physical "renderings" to EA's conceptual modeling and structuring.[1]
- Enterprise design builds a bridge between product-market fit (customer relations) and product delivery (operations), creating a coherent enterprise view.[1]
- A simple framework (from Milan's book *Intersection*) spans abstract to concrete levels, linking design spaces and emphasizing story over EA's tech focus (e.g., "RT").[1][2]
- Enterprise architecture provides valuable methods, maps, and tools, with many practitioners transitioning to enterprise design, despite its limitations in practice.[1]
- The approach combines EA structure with design to make enterprises experiential and tangible.[1][3]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Use the **Enterprise Design Framework** (Big Picture, Anatomy, Frames, Design Space, Rendering) to map enterprise elements across scales, conduct research, prototype, and create physical renderings for validation.[1][3]
- Bridge gaps by exploring problem domains via concept models with domain experts (Domain-Driven Design), aligning viewpoints for a desired future state, and deciding on conceptual designs based on insights.[3]
- Apply an **Enterprise Design System** for teams: identify existing systems, scope a "minimum viable" system using the Enterprise Design Stack (principles, patterns, assets), and include guiding principles, data insights, pattern libraries, automation tools, and collaboration platforms.[5]
- Follow framing aspects (e.g., structure, processes) to collect, map, understand, co-create, and rearrange enterprise elements during transformation.[3]

## Quotes
- "Enterprise design borrows a lot of elements from enterprise architecture... but we add to that... human centric approaches... business design... design research qualitative quantitative doing prototyping validation and bringing it down to a tangible level... something physical... that brings these moments of enterprise earnest to life."[1]
- "We are basically building the bridge between the product market fit on the one side and the product delivery on the other side and enterprise design helps you with understanding your customer relations on the one side and your operations on the other side and makes it fit into one coherent picture."[1]
- "Enterprise architecture mostly stays in the conceptual realm of mapping and modeling... [we combine] that with the design approach to bringing [it] yeah."[1]
- "There's a wealth of knowledge and approaches that we try to connect to [from enterprise architecture]."[1]
