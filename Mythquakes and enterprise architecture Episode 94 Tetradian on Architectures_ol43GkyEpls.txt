something I've been working on for a long time now is a concept I describe as myth quake we depend a lot on assumptions and when those assumptions are on unexamined untested or unverified it's what we might call a myth now when that kind of myth collides with reality Department what we get is what we might call a myth quake yes there's a straight analogy there with an earthquake list attention built up that when it releases there's a kind of explosion now in earthquakes we have to pretty much exponential scales one of which is Richter which most people know which is a measure of the energy of an earthquake but in principle there's only one given Richter measure for any given earthquake and the Mercalli scale which is a measure of impact and by definition we have an almost infinite number of mccally references for any given earthquake so in a myth quake we can measure in terms of the scale of impact in terms of the number of people who undergo or faced with life changing in events from the respective myth quake we can put it in powers of 10 where 10 to the 0 is one person affected in a life-changing way all the way up to ten to the nine point seven which we might consider to be an extinction level event an extinction level myth quake some people suggested I ought to name this scale after my selves call it a grave scale but unfortunately it's a bit too literal so let's just call it mq scale a myth quake scale no earthquakes can be positive to for example a wedding getting married is a myth quake the assumption that I am alone is no longer true there are all sorts of things that are changing having a child born is a myth quake and its own changes a lot of our assumptions in a very real way so this can be very positive as well but it's in this case I'm looking at it particularly in terms of the life changing is more of a challenge particularly because when we refuse to look at the potential for a myth quake the tension increases so that quite often politics can affect a thousand lives ten thousand lives that puts us in the range straightaway of myth quake four to five but when we start mixing things like gender into it or race issues which most people are trying to avoid or ignore then the potential can easily rise to the point where it affects millions tens of millions even hundreds of millions of people that puts us right up in a myth quakes terminal rate which by the fact of ignoring it means that we've ended up with a much greater myth quake than we previously would have done so there are very real risks that arise from denying or refusing to face the potential for a myth quake a very real example which we're dealing with right now is about all the myths about just-in-time logistics and globalized supply chains everything's fine as long as everything can move unchallenged easily across the world when suddenly that isn't the case a lot of our supply chains are breaking down which itself exacerbates the risk because it's now affecting millions of people and tens of millions of people rather than just being a local event so myth quakes we need to do us a whole bunch of things we need to look at myth quick risk and opportunity we need to identify what those are because even with each one of those from an architecture perspective there will be elements of that that are relatively predictable including often the probability of the myth quake itself we can certainly see how elements of a myth might be exacerbated by people refusing to look at it and thus increase the risk that's involved another one is to be prepared for myth quakes we've got to be ready for them practice them even in small things just everyday upsets like in my case being stuck in a hotel room for 14 days because of quarantine rules how do I adapt to that well get by getting ready on the small things with the same methods apply in the large ones we're looking at risk mitigation the the myth quick mitigation and also adaptation when it gets more extreme which is risk reduction but as I say adaptation means for changing four things which the which we cannot reduce the risk there's also a myth point recovery where we need to be looking at how we're dealing with and how we resolve the disruption that a myth quake will cause even at the small scale all the way through to the large ones one of the ways we do that is by particularly by focusing on what the opportunities are for constructive change arising from that myth quake and also admit quick response in real time how we handle the myth quake at the time so that's things like triage which I'm doing right now with things like escrow and so on working out what I can do in a hurry or what are the most urgent sequence of things that I do in case I no longer be able to work and also things like guidance principles what are the choices for example how does this how does this action help everyone rather than only help me so these are things that a myth quake can help us understand but a myth quake is going to occur whenever an unexamined untested or unverified assumption collides with reality Department often in some major way so myth quake is a useful concept to explore that's what I'm hoping to develop more as time goes on
