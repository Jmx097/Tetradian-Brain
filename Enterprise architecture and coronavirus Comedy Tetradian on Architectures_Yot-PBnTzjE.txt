why don't we have to be so serious about everything I mean I know it's serious that we're dealing with but we need some kind of levity perhaps not to the extent of that famous phrase of why so serious from the Joker in one of the Batman films but still we need some element of Liberty just to stay sane when tragedy is everywhere we do need some kind of relief release some kind of comedy in fact um there's that famous not famous phrase about laughter is the best medicine even if it's only black humor dealing with the irony or they sort of all the absurdity of it all it's still a form of humor it takes the edge off the desperate seriousness but it's perhaps here to look at comedy big much more than just laughter then the original sense tragedy is which is it's just an unhappy ending it's a form of play a form of a play or a form of a story that doesn't have a successful outcome whereas comedy is simply one that has a successful outcome that's it so notice how laughter helps us reach a successful outcome if we over focused too much on the seriousness of it all we will get it wrong but it also tends to drive us into some dangerous places if we offer over focus on for example blame or self guilt then we will soon run into a situation where we learn nothing one of the characteristics of the after-action review is that it's foot one of its primary rules is no blame because if there is blame if there is propping self up by putting other down off-loading saying I should have of the demand to go back into the past which we can't do all of those stopped any ability to learn from the situation that we're in and that's a really important problem if everything is fast changing the weaker what to do so another one to that I found particularly in areas like enterprise architecture is the importance of playfulness I've used a toy theater to illustrate how that this traitorous designer for people to experiment with a kind of checklist for the things that are easily missed another one I have used quite often is a toy train to illustrate service design issues like how do what happens when services collide when what happens when services clash with other services when they have to intersect with other services when they pass by other services like on a equivalent above a bridge over a over a road or a railway so how well they intersect they don't actually connect with each other but still have to pass by each other playfulness helps us find the issues that sit in those spaces so one of these things that could enterprise architects can do very usefully in this this time of wild change is to architect for comedy how do we aft architect for acknowledging this even the smallest of happy endings saying hey yes we don't want we succeeded with one one of them actually worked that could be the thing that lifts people up in high stress environments everyone needs to have some tiny break if everything is always the stresses everything's always the overload people are going to crack so we need to architect in those moments of safety those moments of recovery those moments for learning why bees have serious we need the comedy as well to make it all work
