in the past two videos we've been looking at the whole idea of simple yet not simplistic about how to build a method that supports that actual idea using the whole principles on itself so in this video we'll look at some of the things that we actually did to make this happen looking at all the different metaphors the different assumptions the challenges that we had to face to make it all work the challenge that we faced when trying to build an EI method that would cover the full scope and scale was to find a way to simplify the very real complexity that covers the whole of that space let's take a look at some of the dimensions of that complexity the first one is fairly straightforward that we have one thing that follows another nothing complicated there step by step but we then want to find going diving down into the detail so if we think of that as step by step then these dive down into deeper and deeper levels of detail and we're also running many things in parallel so straight away we've got three dimensions that are all clashing with each other so for example each of these has its own step by step and is often running things in parallel as well and each of those have their own detail so you can see the complexity builds very fast indeed to add to the complexity on top of that something that we find here in this place might well cause us to redesign or rethink what we were doing back over here so if you think of that as being the step by step the-- the sequence the chain the links that's the parallel that's the detail these are links from any point to any point and that may cause us to go back and rethink so this builds and all the time we have to find a way to store the information so that we can get at it again and also insights can appear completely at random so right down in the detail somewhere here is insight light bulb we that may not be relevant even to the task that we're doing but may well be important elsewhere so that was the challenge we faced so the first way the place we started was a very classic very old model slightly reworked she's the the old group dynamics or forming storming norming sequence also the Chinese five elements sequence which we framed as purpose people preparation process and performance all rotating around kind of pivot that was our starting point but we needed to make it human we needed to make it accessible we needed to handle all of this complexity all in one go so to make it more human the first thing we did was to literally make it human we built it as a kind of a series of rooms around a central atrium each of these being for example similar to the way that strategy people work the way that people people work the preparation the planning of something the actual doing of the work the process then following through one what did we do what did we learn always we're looking for this basic principle of what's the big picture what are the boundaries what's the plan of the preparation what are we actually doing what are we capturing right now what have we learned from this how well did we do in terms of the original purpose but we soon found that while that handles the step-by-step aspects and the continuation of the linking of things it didn't handle parallel and it didn't handle detail so we tried another way so the next metaphor was to emphasize again the people part of this and to focus on how information flowed back and forth how we kept returning to this central atrium as the place where we stored the information and so that we could possibly go back if we need to it isn't just a fixed step-by-step but we found that that didn't handle the problem of parallel or detail either it made it more human it made it more accessible but it still didn't actually solve the problem in the next attempt we focused on the the act the storing of information so that we had this idea of the pathway where there was a loop to it but we store the information at the end of each phase and each phase is quite distinct but again that gives us the idea of the step by step looping which it often does but it still doesn't tackle the parallel it does tackle the the the storing of information but it doesn't tackle the detail nor this building level of complexity so next one we focused on making the sorry that the previous one was rather clumsy with with the emphasis too much on the storing of information so we say I had used the idea of folders where collecting information and storing it in folders and again making it human by putting people in the space by making it human but emphasizing much more clearly what's going on we now dropped the idea of a loop because what it was is just a pattern and the pattern may appear in each place in each way it's still just the same pattern a loop is a particular type of step-by-step relationship but it isn't the only one in another face we emphasize the folders even more and what happens inside the folders but a side-effect of that was we actually dropped it being less made it less human we found that all the attempts to make it human actually got in the way so we still kept the person in there making it real and focusing much more around the actual tasks and concerns being done but we tackled the complexity by in a sense not tackling it but by building the complexity in the way it in related rather than try to put it into the pattern itself in the form that's in the final book this is essentially just the same idea we've accepted that we can't actually include all of the complexity but by focusing on the pattern and keeping the pattern consistent every time we end up with something that is still absolutely consistent every scope every scale type of content any type of context web defy identifying these we start a mission which is essentially one of these package to down we start we start with a gun issue we identify who's going to do it why we're doing it what the actual question is and what we're going to do with it we then use the structure this standard pattern what's the big picture what's the boundaries who's involved who's making those choices what is the plan the preparation for any given task what's the action for given any any given task what's the review for any given task so these if it often become just little more than checks worse these are the ones we do all the time at the end of a folder we're reviewing the whole thing which is giving us the answer and we tackle the complexity by in a sense removing it and yet still leaving all the hooks in place to handle all the types of complexity that may arise that's what's in the book that's what we've settled on as being the best approach that we could do to keep it simple in the midst of enormous complexity so that's the basic change mapping method or approach what's the issue let's start a mission within this we have any number of what's the context what's the scope enormous numbers of plan action review plan action review plan action review with an ending to do the review of the whole and returning the answer that we need thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't
