in a previous video we introduced scan a simple frame in which to make sense of complexity what I want to do in this video is to show how you can use it to guide conversations about the decisions you need for a context and not particularly the types of decisions you need for that context the first quiet one here is that we've got this distinction about how much time we have before we need to take action in the now on the other axis we've got a level of uncertainty now one of our first descriptions we can put in here is what we might call the inverse Einstein boundary the classic description and Einstein said is that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results but there's a certain point when we're dealing with inherent uncertainty where there's a transition where the definition of expecting the same results so on one side we have sameness on the other side we have difference where we either have to have to do different things to get the same kind of result or if we do the same things we will get or may get a different result so on one side we've got certainty or order and on the other we've got an order so we can look at this and say there's a boundary here occur different kinds of decisions going on as we get closer to the moment of action we run out of time to think and so there's a boundary we can use here which is that transition from time to think to no time to think left so that's time to think and back here we had same different so in this kind of area when we've got plenty of time to think or remain and we're looking for certainty for order we can calculate what's going on it's often complicated but it's calculus we can make it calculated by the time we have no time left to think we need things to be simple over here when we've still got time to think and we're dealing with uncertainty we're dealing with ambiguity generally whereas when Camping's are completely uncertain and we are dealing with no time to think we have all we have left is the not known we need some kind of guidance that can help us decision-making that can help us in something that is not known so to some extent what we have now is a distinction on one side between truth which I'll put capitals as our quotes around as opposed to value or usefulness is it useful we don't have time to concern ourselves with whether it's so-called true so what we typically get here is that these are quantitative whereas these tend to be qualitative these ones we don't have time for anything other than a binary true/false and we're on the last one we all we get we have is in the moment and nothing else really nothing else at all so if we can give the kind of descriptions we've got quite different types of decision-making here we've got things like rules regulations things like work instructions where we rotate through a list here we have things that about balance that things are the trade offs we've got multiple factors we know what the factors are we calculate where our options so we also got things where they can build up in hard systems theory where they will snowball or where they can damp down we can track those in a quantitative way over here we have patterns we have heuristics we have recursion we have things inside things there are things that are fractal we've still got time to think we're looking very much in terms of qualitative whereas down in here we need ways to shake things up when or where we're being shaken up and what guides us most is principles so if we put that in another way then what we've got here are rules algorithms patterns or heuristics and here we have the one major guidance we have is principals so you can use this kind of frame to help us identify what types of decisions we need and what the support mechanisms we need for them in terms of whether they are dealing with the same or the different in dealing with and also in terms of whether we've got time to think and go back or whether we are committed to action so there's a simple way to use the scan frame to help guide us in sorting out what types of decisions we need in any given context thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
