something that we're seeing a lot now is people asking what's happening to the future where will the future be when can we get back to normal but there's a real question about what is back to normal what what is normal anyway is it even possible to get back to what we previously had also what does the future mean one of the themes I've seen so often in Enterprise Architecture is a very poor grasp of multiple time scales most people who look at seem to or talk would seem to be talking about the future as being a maximum of two or three years away but when we're dealing with any kind of long term project anywhere military example for example you'll often have things that are expected to have a lifecycle of 20 30 40 years when you're dealing with healthcare by definition you need been dealing with a lifetime of at least a hundred years if you're doing with epidemiology often a longer than that with some aspects of civil engineering you're certainly going to be dealing with at least 50 to 100 years and often in cases went into the century's parts of the london sewerage system left over from roman period 2,000 years ago so we need to be thinking in terms of multiple time scales at the same time so we're talking about futures not just future the future so after we didn't need to add to Enterprise Architecture a lot of the formal disciplines of futures or strategic foresight it's not about prediction like a lot of people seem to be thinking in terms of the idea of as these verses to be we predict the to be it doesn't work that way the only time when the future is known is when it's actually the now it's it when it ceases to be in the future up until then there's always uncertainty so futures is plural not singular it's not to the future but futures that distinction is really important when we start to make sense of where we're going with after coronavirus or even since there's a high likelihood we will be with it now forever what we need is a dynamic adaptation to an emerging future whatever the future emerges we need to be able to adapt to it and adapt our work or organizations our business to it as if we change that way this is where things like scenario planning come in I do here mean scenarios in the much big picture sense not the much more simplistic sense that you'll get in something like TOGAF where scenario is simply the glorified use case what I'm talking about is this scenario at a much larger scale often global but our business has to adapt to that that's the kind of scenarios that we're dealing with now now there are standard ways of looking at scenarios we wanted to build a set of stories effectively about what the nature of the future will be and how we need then from there how we need to react as each one of those options becomes more real so when you add dynamic adaptation to an emerging future we've got the multiple time scales going on so over what periods of time and how things are happening now coronavirus is unquestionably a huge challenge right now it's affecting millions hundreds of millions of people but these still quite trivial challenges compared to what's coming up there's a resource depletion there's climate change doesn't matter whether you what the cause was we know there is climate change happening and all of these are beginning to come more so a lot of the economics assumptions like the whole basis of globalization of hyperglobalisation rather were efficiency or what effectiveness is gained by having something manufactured only in one place in the world and relying on global supply chains to cover the rest may not work when you have no supply check now when you've got breaks in your supply chain hyper localization is not necessarily good because it can be stunningly inefficient very wasteful so how do we find we now need to make that in future terms problematic in other words something that is discussable how do we find the right balance dynamically over longer periods of time and another one which is part of the research have done over the past few decades I cannot see any way in which a possession based economy could be made sustainable it always ends up as being a pyramid game which ultimately can only cannibalize itself into oblivion if we keep on going with the current path we've got as things get tighter we're not going to survive but the point here is that we've got some lead time that is sure about we can't make a possession based economy sustainable we've got a lead time of maybe twenty to thirty years to really start going on it but that means that we need to be starting on it now all of these issues need to be understood now we need to start on them now when it's the best plug good time to plant a tree fifty years ago when we get there it's already too late so we need to be starting to work on these futures now and that means we need to get a better understanding of the futures toolkit and build it into our enterprise architecture practice
