this one's a follow-up from a suggestion from Allen Woods who reminds me that GDP are the generalized data protection regulation from the European Union is coming to force a very soon so GDP RS get is European Union regulations but it's going to have a global fully global impact but if we're not ready it's going to hurt if things think requires things like explicit opt-in and single agreed use of personal info to be blunt it's going to kill a lot of business models including ones that most people don't want such as spam cold calling so it's a good time to remind people remind everyone that people are not assets they're not possessed by a company neither as customers nor as employees the crucial understanding here is that the relationship with the person is the asset not the person themselves in fact the only time when a person is an aspect is when they're a slave which is not exactly a good way to describe anything so we need to manage that asset that relationship as asset exactly as we do for any other kind of asset we can create it we can read it we update it we maintain it these are all standard functions that we think of in terms of data assets or physical assets but a crucial point about understanding about a relationship asset is that it exists between and it can be dropped from either end so a customer can end the relationship even if we don't know that it's been ended just as a personal example right now I ordered a particular type of shirt from Amazon I'm now being besieged by adverts from all manner of people trying to sell me exactly the same shirt that I've already bought this is extremely frustrating so I'm the relationship with those companies is wrecked by misusing this I do single use of information but also crucial to understand is that information about a relationship is not the same as the relationship itself if we make that mistake then that's where a lot of problems come with CRM systems customer relationship management systems in fact a CRM to a large extent is based on a fundamental error in assuming that information about a relationship is the same as the relationship don't make that mistake in your architecture so the crucial one here is to understand that people are not assets it is the relationship that we have with those people that is the actual asset and without that asset of that relationship we don't have access to the person themselves we need to maintain the asset exactly is the same that's for any other kind of asset create read update delete maintain the rest an information about a relationship is not the same as the relationship itself don't mix them up
