when we talk about investors in enterprise architecture particularly business architecture we need to realize that there are five completely different types of investor we need to be really careful not to mix them up the first of these is the one we actually want the most from a business perspective which is the symbiote someone who's committed to us is part of the same story but brings something in that we can't access otherwise maybe money but it might also be ideas might also be support emotional or social support of various kinds they are investing their hope their intentions and so on into us but they're committed to our story they're committed to us that they succeed if we succeed and we succeed if they succeed the second type is the parasite we'll have to call them that they're committed to us they provide typically money or whatever but they commit themselves once they're not really committed to our story they're committed to what they're going to get back from us they will attach themselves to us and may or may not actually provide anything at all but they're primarily there to take rather than to support or to give the third type sounds better but actually isn't it's a grazer this is like a a herd of goats or whatever careering across a field they're committed to the field as a whole but not to any individual blade of grass within that within that field and they require for their success they require that the field spends much of its energy regenerating itself so that they gain energy from it they're committed to the field as a whole but not to any one entity in it it's where people for example may be committed to an industry but will jump around from indus from player to player within the industry to get what they need out of it the fourth type is the one that a lot of us know all too well which is the predator they have no interest whatsoever in the story they have no commitment whatsoever to anyone they're just there to take now they can be slightly helpful the whole creative destruction that a predator culls the dysfunctional end of the herd and so on but generally speaking they are destructive certainly to the individual but they do at least put some effort in to hunt down and drive down their prey the final card the fifth kind is the scavenger now they don't even put in the effort to hunt down the prey often they will wait around for a predator or else get a predator to do the work for them and then drive the predator off so that they can take so that's the sequence that we typically want them in and from a business perspective from an individual businesses perspective that's the order that we want them in we want the symbiote supported most and we want to keep the scavengers at bay the most unfortunately our entire economics is based on doing it the other way around our stock markets for example prioritize the scavenger first they place the scavenger first and the symbiote last there are some very interesting questions that we might explore around that but for now for our own organizations we need to understand that we need to keep the scavengers at bay and focus on finding symbiotes people who are actually committed to the same story and that are committed to us as well to working with us
