digital transformation it's a huge buzzword at the moment and not surprisingly several people have asked me to comment on it particularly rogério heads us and Alec Blair so when is enterprise architecture fit in relation to digital transformation I see it as a tool and a roadmap to drive digital transformation efforts but the crucial thing we need to note is that it's not about the digital really it's much more about the transformation bit digital transformation in essence is business change that is enabled by new technology it's not actually about the technology itself there's a real danger here and we can look at lessons learned from previous failures look at business process reengineering from the 90s for example only e-commerce from the late 90s or addre McAfee's Enterprise to point naught from the from the early 2000s there were four ways to get it wrong and most of the implementations fell for one two or even all of them the first one is to get over excited about the technology to focus on the technology for its own sake it's like the old one about build a better mousetrap and people would beaten path to your door they won't you've got to think about the system as a whole literally about the whole of the enterprise the technology is not the center the second one is to try to make it benefit only some players usually the expense of everyone else the few business process re-engineering efforts that really worked or ones that started from the people issues first and used it to rethink how the business would work better as a whole the way to get it wrong is to think the technology will enable us to get rid of a thousand people there and another thousand there it doesn't work because people are better at dealing with the uncertain bits that you can't come the technology which leads us to the next mistake which is the delusion that the technology can do everything well generally speaking it can't technology is excellent for things that are highly repeatable and very bad but things that are unique that a value based that have got sort of squidgy bits to it lots of fuzziness computer technology including and current so-called AI artificial intelligence is not well suited to high uncertainty and high uniqueness it still isn't there which relates to the last one which is believing that the technology will on its own will at last give us control absolute certainty whenever we're dealing with the real world there will always be uncertainty if we think otherwise we're setting ourselves up for disaster so to make digital transformation not to repeat the same mistakes we need to understand that those mistakes killed everything very few people got it right and the ones that did got stellar answers so we need an architecture that supports the whole of the system not just the IT bits also we need to understand what the technology can and can't do so yes we do need to look very closely at the technology and at its capabilities I said that it's not about the technology but Andrew McAfee was right when he said it's not not about the technology these options would not be available to us without that new technology but we need to start always from the business issues and business concerns first from the people concerns first from the business drivers first and only then think about how we can bring a new technology to support a new way of working don't get it the wrong way around if we want a digital transformation that works we need to start from the people and an architecture that supports that rather than from the tech you first
