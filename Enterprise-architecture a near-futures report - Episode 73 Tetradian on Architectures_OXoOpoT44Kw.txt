continuing on with this theme of a kind of status report on enterprise architecture what I want to look at now is the kind of the near future where things are going right now much of this already exists but it's very unevenly distributed but interestingly most of the development is happening in what I call the small countries Australia Sweden New Zealand Canada Netherlands particularly perhaps Belgium all of the countries where people are forced to be generalists just because there aren't enough people in a technical pool and we're not crippled by hyper specialism so the first thing that's happening is that there's a very clear need and action towards breaking out of the IT centric box if we look at classically TOGAF 7 was built around after Tokyo 7 was very much inside in it was IT looking at itself up to an enterprise wide scope yes but it was still only IT and slowly renovated data applications and finally what they called business architecture which in essence was anything not IT that might affect her team what would do so that's going from the inside in to first beginnings of looking at the inside out at the outer world the beginnings of looking at things like customer journey but we need outside in the world outside looking in as in the other side of the customer journey the other side of the supply chain and also we need outside out the story that is the enterprise beginning to look at itself we're breaking out of big IT in a large organisations with vast most organizations now a reliant old cloud and don't run their own data centers we need to look much more at end to end on some often very complex supply chains and delivery chains right the way through not just through the IT but where IT interweaves with the physical world we look at digital transformation and realize that transformation is a bit of a misnomer any transformation first of all is about people first and the technology is actually a secondary concern the technology enables possibilities but it isn't the thing that transform and finally we've got very human oriented concerns about where the product is information and whether a huge legal and other complications are rising from the way that we handle personal information unless other related issues like security so we're moving very much beyond the classic IT towards a whole of enterprise view and we need fundamentally new methods frameworks tools and more to make it work but the next trap is business centrism for thinking that the organization is the center of the world there isn't there is no center to any organisation if we look at the classic peanuts tag we've got a huge problem where the old idea was that we had enterprise architecture is business architecture plus data and applications plus technology be dead but we then realized that the idea of business architecture being anything not IT that might affect IT wasn't enough so we had the idea that business architecture is inside and outside at the same time what we're looking at now is even more crazy whether we have the business architecture outside the enterprise architecture and inside it we've got enterprise architecture business architecture enterprise architecture business architecture data applications technology we need to do something better than this we've also got to break free from the machine or money oriented view of the organization the kind of tailor issed world where people are plug-in interchangeable units to something that's much more human much more service oriented approach to organizations and how organizations operate so all of this demands a much broader role for the Enterprise Architect very much the role of the generalist in working in parallel with domain specialists but the only the one who looks Oh the entirety and where the basic approaches are exactly the same for every type of enterprise every context every type of scope a story every type of scale we've got an emphasis on story and we've also got a real awareness of fractality that the same patterns repeat at multiple layers so the way that enterprise architecture is moving is not moving away from IT but including IT in a much much much larger scope where - literally the architecture of the enterprise that's where enterprise architecture is going
