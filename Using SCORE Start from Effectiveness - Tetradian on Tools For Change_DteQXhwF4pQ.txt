in this series of videos we are looking at score a very simple frame in which to help us gain insights about any kind of issue strategic tactical or otherwise it's very straightforward I've scrawled it out like you would scroll out on a notebook or on a whiteboard because that's the kind of places they're most likely to be used what we have is we have a question that we're going to start with which in this case is one which is how do we improve efficiency we look for the strengths the capabilities that we have we look at the challenges the things that we need to do the capabilities that we need to build we look towards the outside world at options which are always opportunities and risks always seem together these we see in the outside world and what is the information we're getting back from the real world but one of the questions always get asked is where do we start and the obvious one here is if it's something of a quality factor such as efficiency we're going to focus on effectiveness the effectiveness or the success criteria the the quality concerns that help us reach towards the promise that we've made to our own shared enterprise the broader space that we operate within so if we look at inefficiency there's a useful phrase someone came up with where he said that every scrap of waste is something that we've paid for that we can't sell and some examples that we might look for some cues that we might use here are things like reduced waste materials waste reduce rework reduce bottlenecks themes of that kind that help us pinpoint particular areas that are inefficiency another one might be reduced technical debt by that we mean look for the things that will trap us over the longer term the short term plunges that will come back to bite us those are hidden inefficiencies that are not immediate but are going to bite us really hard so to do that the first thing we're going to need is information do we have the information that's the first question so I'm going to put that as a challenge do we have the information what is our current waste we're going to need to look if we haven't got it it's going to be a challenge if we have got it we can lift it from our existing systems but I then would want to ask does this actually give us the information that we need often we're collecting information that is no use to us at all so this is existing information but the question here is is the info any use we can also look outside to our existing customers would look at the outside world what expectations for example if people are using our product or our service in an inefficient way that's inefficient for us then we need to know because that will come back to reduce waste particularly issues such as failure demand where we've got a vast amounts of hidden rework our customer service is often inflicted with that now as we really each time we look at the wastage issue there's a risk there it's costing us it's costing us in every sense money people time market share reputation there are lots of risks that arise from any of these but if we resolve them any inefficiency we resolve creates opportunity and if there's an opportunity we're going to need to test that look for the information so this is an example that might lead for a conversation of an hour or two to explore these options really what we're doing here is we're using this as a simple visual checklist which gives us trails to follow not just making lists but giving us trails of exploration trails of derivation just as a visual checklist to look for what are our capabilities the challenges that we have to face the opportunities and risks that arise and the response is that we either have or that we need to look for from the outside that will help us improve efficiency that's how we can use score when we start from effectiveness as our starting point thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
