in the earlier episodes in this brief series on power and Enterprise Architecture we've looked at that power is the ability to do work the relationship between power and responsibility so what I want to end with now this series is a brief checklist on power and Enterprise Architecture and how what to look for so the definitions we had again power is the ability to do work rather than the very common tendency to regard work power as the ability to avoid work to offload it on to others the ability to do work as a personal choice on purpose a sense of purpose and also power in relation to the rehabilitation responses is what we mean by responsibility so the first checklist item is what is that if power is the ability to do work what is the work to be done what work needs to be done in the context that you're looking at what needs to be changed physical data relationships connections to purpose to aims to enterprise what is the work that needs to be done next checklist item what are the energies the assets the resources what are you going to do the work on what ability do you need to do that work what are the resources that you need that will enable power to create the space in which it is possible to do the work a third checklist item is about who or what has the power and responsibility to do the work who has the ability to do it and the ability to choose appropriate this is a lot where skill comes in for example skill and experience if someone doesn't have the skill they're not able to choose the appropriate responses for the context in when the things get messy when things get difficult a fourth item what are the risks of in the context where a system might prop itself up by putting others down where a person or a system overall the technical system might create a deadlock where all the power is being used in competition one other contexts here where you can see things are knocking against each other and pushing hard wasting all of the energy and the work on doing nothing at all next item what systems tend to offload responsibilities onto another for example if Swan system runs open-loop and expects the other parts of the system to catch up to close the loop for it a system which just runs straight away with no breaks a system that churns out work after work after work with no actual assessment of whether it's on purpose another item when we look at the whole system one of the mutuality is what are the balance points the interlocks to make the system balanced at fair so that you get the most work on purpose out of the overall system how does the system check what are the checks and balances that make it all work and a last item to consider if there are all these mutuality Ziff there are all these interlocks then who just gets to decide what is fair who decides what to get what is balanced because if those people themselves are not being fair if those people are offloading work onto others if those systems are choosing to offload work onto others then again the whole system is going to be wasteful if you like who's watching the watches what are the checks and balances that work throughout how do they apply to everyone and who gets to decide so that's a checklist that you can use live in real work in enterprise architecture tackling the relentlessly political nature of so much of enterprise architecture work
