# Analysis: Economics and enterprise architecture: Episode 93, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video applies enterprise architecture (EA) principles to global economics, framing humanity as the enterprise within the Earth's environment and critiquing current systems for fragility, wastefulness, and mismatch between infinite monetary growth and finite resources. It urges a shift from money-centric views to holistic "household management" focused on long-term survivability, resilience, and resource redistribution. The pandemic exposes flaws like just-in-time supply chains and non-renewable resource depletion, such as helium scarcity threatening electronics and medical tech.

## Key Takeaways
- **Economics as household management**: Economics means managing all aspects of the "household" (global humanity), not just money; the environment is the parent system, as "we don't survive if the world doesn't survive."[transcript]
- **Enterprise scope**: The enterprise is humanity in the context of the entire world; economics is a "wholly owned subsidiary of the environment."[transcript]
- **Core human needs**: Prioritize life, love, hope, resilience, adaptability, and antifragility over indefinite time scales.[transcript]
- **Flaws in current economics**: Resources gravitate to where least needed (possession economy), high waste of non-renewables like helium (11 years left, critical for MRI and electronics), fragile just-in-time supply chains, and infinite money growth on a finite planet.[transcript]
- **EA lens benefits**: EA disciplines reveal "as-is" issues (fragility, low durability) and guide "to-be" designs for survivability and thriving.[transcript]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Apply classic EA questions to economics: Define the **enterprise** (humanity + world), identify **needs** (life, love, hope, resilience, antifragility), map **dependencies** (resource flows, renewability), assess **as-is** state (fragility, waste), and roadmap to **to-be** (sustainable, adaptive design).[transcript]
- Shift from money-only focus to holistic management: View economics as RBPE ("really big picture enterprise architecture") at global scale, emphasizing long-term thrivability over consume-consume-consume models.[transcript]
- Use EA for visibility: Make current flaws visible (e.g., helium depletion, supply chain breakdowns) to inform redesign, similar to EA maturity levels for governance and optimization.[1]

## Quotes
- "Economics literally translates as the management of the household... money is part of managing the household but it's certainly not the only part."[transcript]
- "Economics is the wholly owned subsidiary of the environment not the other way round."[transcript]
- "Resources are simply not where they're most needed... the natural gravity over possession economy is the resources naturally trend towards where they're least needed."[transcript]
- "High fragility a just-in-time supply chain model is not exactly robust... Helium for example we've only got about 11 years of it left... no helium equals no electronics."[transcript]
- "If we start looking at economics with an enterprise architecture lens there's a lot we can discover."[transcript]
