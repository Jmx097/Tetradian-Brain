following on from yesterday's video about myth quakes introducing the idea of a myth quake someone asked isn't myth quick just cognitive dissonance what's different well the short answer is yes sort of but the selection a lot more to it so cognitive dissonance yes it's one source common source of myth quakes but there are others and the most obvious one is actually not so much cognitive dissonance as the absence of any cognition at all following habit rather than actually thinking about something so a myth quick arises when with an assumption collides with reality a misplaced assumption so cognitive dissonance itself is only about the fact or the mechanism of a mismatch it doesn't really tell us anything more than that whereas myth quick focuses more on the consequences of the mismatch rather than just the fact of mismatch so a guiding criterion were using for impact is that it's got life-changing effects that it literally changes someone's life that's when a myth great becomes significant there are masses upon masses of little myth quakes right the way through the day but little things that don't match up but the ones that we think are significant up to the level of a quake rather than turn a tremor are the ones that have some kind of life-changing impact and we've then got a measurement scale that goes in powers of ten so it's an exponential scale so ten to the zero means only one person's life is changed ten to the one or myth quake one level is that can be up to ten people's lives being changed here by the time we get to so we can easily get something that's a thousand tens of thousands millions tens of millions right up into the billions level until we get to a myth quake in nine and somewhat which is actually an extinction level event which we have a few of those on the horizon so just sayin cognitive dissonance doesn't tell us anything about this extra material about the actual the impact of that cognitive dissonance also it could be in a sense it also helps to us to identify that something because cognitive dissonance merely tells us that the thinking is wrong not what they want what to do about that wrong thinking and miss Blake also adds a whole systematic structure for what to do before during and after a mythical way before we want to focus on identifying the possibility for a myth quake mitigating any possible myth quake and also building preparedness of when any myth quake might occur during them the myth quake we've got structures that are about keeping panic at bay but providing guiding principles and so on dealing with triage and after we've got to focus on recovery are also going to focus on learning so if we just say it's the same as cognitive dissonance all of that is missing but also a much simpler one if we look at just the terms cognitive dissonance versus myth quake cognitive dissonance is a tangled term it isn't even about sound anyway so dissonance isn't even correct it's it's kind of technical some even might describe it as elitist it's six syllables long it's a tangle to say whereas myth quake rolls off the tongue in the same way that mistake does in fact there are some comparisons there but also myth quake as a term it's immediately identifiable it's descriptive there is a quake there was a myth involved and there's a quaint going on but it's going to direct and actually quite accurate analogy with earthquakes the buildup of tension and so on and the way that tension can be build up the more and more we ignore the stresses that are driving that that potential myth quake the other thing we can do here is we can use that thing as an example as a worked example of myth quake itself so there's an assumption right here in the statement isn't it just cognitive dissonance well it's an assumption it's an honor it's unexamined it's untested it's unverified in that sense it's a myth we have no way of sight knowing beforehand whether it's true but when we would collide with a reality Department right here in a very simple way where I've explained there's much more to myth quake than just cognitive dissonance then that's the actual impact so it means that we have not just a myth but a myth quake it's collided with reality demand there are consequences to that collision the consequence here is probably not life-changing for anyone maybe I don't know but it shows us that there are possibilities here that all options that are just being missed that are not available to us if we just say arbitrary label it as cognitive dissonance because it doesn't give us any guidance as to what to do about that cognitive dissonance the fact of not having access to those means to change something means that them a tiny myth quake could well become a much bigger myth quake with greater and greater impact so when we look at this in terms of the recovery from this particular myth quake discovering that is isn't myth quick just cognitive dissonance is actually an incorrect assumption what do we do to recover from this well the most important one is don't jump too quickly to assumptions and particularly don't jump to jump to obvious comparisons when you haven't actually looked in any depth of what's going on now that applies not just to with quake itself but for example to most of what's called currently called Enterprise Architecture my main field there's a cotton a huge myth quake around the idea that it's only about IT instead we need to realize that it's about the whole and the assumption that it's only about IT has very serious consequences for what we can and can't access and work on during that event of working on an enterprise architecture likewise right now I'm stuck in a hotel having had the mismatch of the myth that I could arrive in Australia at any time and discovering that actually no I can't so no it's not just cognitive dissonance there's more to it than that
