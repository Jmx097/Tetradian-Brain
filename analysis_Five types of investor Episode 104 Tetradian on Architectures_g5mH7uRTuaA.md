# Analysis: Five types of investor: Episode 104, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video outlines five distinct types of investors in enterprise and business architecture—symbiote, parasite, grazer, predator, and scavenger—using ecological metaphors to distinguish their levels of commitment to an organization's story and success. Businesses should prioritize symbiotes, who share mutual success, while minimizing scavengers, as economic systems like stock markets often reverse this healthy order.

## Key Takeaways
- **Symbiote**: Ideal investor, fully committed to the organization's story and success, providing money, ideas, or support with mutual interdependence—they succeed if the business succeeds.[Transcript]
- **Parasite**: Commits to the host but primarily to extract value, offering resources like money without true alignment to the business's story.[Transcript]
- **Grazer**: Committed to the broader field or industry, not individual entities; jumps between players, draining resources without loyalty to any one.[Transcript]
- **Predator**: No commitment to anyone; destructively takes value, though may cull weak elements via creative destruction.[Transcript]
- **Scavenger**: Least desirable; exerts minimal effort, waiting for predators to weaken prey before stealing remains.[Transcript]
- Stock markets prioritize scavengers over symbiotes, creating tension for organizations that must focus on symbiotes to thrive.[Transcript][1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Identify investor types by assessing commitment to your specific story: seek symbiotes who invest hope, intentions, and resources in mutual success.[Transcript]
- Prioritize symbiotes in business architecture by nurturing relationships where success is interdependent, while keeping scavengers at bay to maintain focus.[Transcript][1]
- In enterprise-architecture modeling (e.g., Enterprise Canvas), separate aligned investors (symbiote-like, sharing enterprise values) from misaligned ones to avoid distraction and failure; model value-flows distinctly as they often reverse typical directions.[1]
- Regularly evaluate stakeholders in market models, asking "what's missing?" to distinguish investor impacts and gaps in responsibility.[2]

## Quotes
- "We need to be really careful not to mix them up."[Transcript]
- "They are investing their hope their intentions and so on into us but they're committed to our story they're committed to us that they succeed if we succeed and we succeed if they succeed."[Transcript] (on symbiotes)
- "Our entire economics is based on doing it the other way around our stock markets for example prioritize the scavenger first and the symbiote last."[Transcript]
- "We need to keep the scavengers at bay and focus on finding symbiotes people who are actually committed to the same story."[Transcript]
