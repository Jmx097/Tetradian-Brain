the other day the colleague asked me to look again at the classic male classic bimodal mistake that's pushed by a certain consultancy but it is just plain wrong it's pushed the idea that there is mode one which is people who deal with stuff that is stable keeping the lights on all that kind of thing they're supposed to mow - that deals with change and is really the exciting bit and that's what they're saying just plain wrong not least because it leaves it out an extremely important middle that links between them one of the people has pushed back hardest on this is Simon Wardley with his model of pioneers settlers and town planners if you like the town planners that the production people are the mode one and the pioneers of the mode that the mode to the change people but there needs to be people in the middle the settlers in his model that link these together another way to reframe this is explore expand exploit we first do the exploration but we then make that exploration what we found during exploration into something useful and also deal with issues such as scale we can describe this quite simply in the transition when we look at the classic mode 102 idea is being explore and then exploit and they only just touch there's nothing linking them together apart from a point where they just touch whereas if we look at it as explore expand exploit we have a very clear crossover that starts in the middle of one and ends in the middle of the other so well deal with issues also in the expand also dealing with things like scaling a lot of startups fail completely when they hit a scaling problem it's too easy to happen it happens all the time IT can expand easily but most other things can't the scaling issue and if we don't design for scaling as a whole rather than just the easy IT bit then we're gonna hit huge problems as we expand outward but the other one that had a bit was when I talked about explore expand exploit some people really push back against the word exploit they didn't like it but it the I want that in ambiguity to be in there it's really important that it is in there because exploit is in the sense of Kirov valent functional sense is exploiting the resources that we have making good use of it making the most efficient reliable least wasteful use of those of those resources but there's also the negative version about exploit in the sense of exploitation a very dysfunctional view and notice what we have in the full rodgers model of this we have said the song war do want roughly there are surprises but roughly maps to cite to the rogers model of innovators early adopters early majority of pioneer settlers town planner says explore expand exploit but in the rogers model of technology adoption cycle there's two more there's the late majority who use who do that real focus on getting the best use out of it which is exploited as saying that functional sense and then we have what he calls the laggards i tend to think of them as the stairs the people who are at the other bleeding edge of any technology who are working out how to reuse it having get the best out of something that and a technology that often people who have forgotten think of were rare breeds trusts plant conservation groups in the technology space things like people who you still use magnetic core or valve radio there are certain technology technologies that have very real uses and in some cases are actually coming back and that's the work of those people about other bleeding edge of the technology looping back to the innovators but when we get this dysfunctional version the early majority becomes the buyer it doesn't actually it just simply buys it in and this is again what the big consultancies are selling into and then we have the exploit in a dysfunctional sense where there's no responsibility for the technology and on both of those two heirs the innovators of the early adopters on one side that let the stairs on the other it becomes magically someone else's problem we grab what we can we get them with the efficiency out of the middle there's less no honesty there and it produces huge amounts of technical debt huge amounts of waste huge amounts of add to the property so be very careful about what happens when we get to that exploit phase and how we clearly link it background to the new to the next way of reusing the same technologies so explore expand exploit we explore new ideas we make them usable as we expand that idea we then exploit it but always be careful to make sure that when we're exploiting in the sense of being being clear being honest being fair being respectful as opposed to exploiting and dumping all the problems on everyone else
