another useful tool in terms of skills and mapping out skills is what we call the skill modes map this is a very simple to access framework historically actually derived from the work of Carl Jung but it's where things will describe it as the swamp metaphor because it's about we need different ways of working ways of thinking different ways of interacting at different stages in in any kind of work as well see it's not about individual people or the mode that each person belongs in though it's often we will need the different modes across a team but it's also people have a particular orientation yes but we've got to be able to handle all four modes in order to do the work it's called the swamp of metaphor because imagine a swamp it's not a little kind of bleak muddy mess it's just every possibility is there but if you try to stay too long in one place in the wrong in the wrong kind of place you'll disappear beneath the surface and be gone so we've got for quite different ways of working on modes mindsets that to work in that space the first if you like is the artist you run like hell you run like crazy you never get you're always getting lots and lots of new experiences this is where you get new ideas from but the moment you stop and say I've found my style there's a sad little bloopers you disappear beneath the surface and you also can't really connect ideas together they're just ideas without any kind of frame the next one it's the almost the opposite extreme it's the the believer it's about inner truth about inner absolute certainty it fits best with things in a serve it precedes not even as if something is true but it asserts that it is true we believe completely and this is what a trainee does needs to do we need to actually be able to do this the next one is so I think that one sticks a pole in a fixed place and there are people to climb up the pole a better view of the overview of the ground around them but you're not in touch with the swamp when you're up high up on a pole now the next mode is like making a platform what's such is the scientist where we've a platform between a bunch of poles otherwise known as the ivory towers of academia but the catch is that to do this we're making firm level ground you know in the swamp hobgoblins and FAL fields coming rushed away at the sound of the first myth being exploded and so on that kind of thing but the trouble is it's no longer the swamp it's no longer it actually shuts out new possibilities so that is a that's something we need that's the theory base but it isn't necessarily the answer to everything Enterprise Architecture for example about any form of architecture is every bit as much art as science it needs to find the right balance between them dynamically but we also got a group of people out on the edges of the platform or even further beyond who spread their weight on swab shoes they resolve the swamp but staying in one place for just long enough it's what we call the Builder or the engineer when the technologist for example is light waves or particles the answer is yes therefore no but I can use an idea rather than a certain truth I use it as if it is true rather than saying like the believer that it is true these are different approaches different attitudes different ways of working so when we look at them in terms of scan the the believer is what the training does it's down in that lower lift or the close to the action of the good certainty you've then got in the in the upper lift still dealing with certainty you've got the apprentice who is the same as the science same attitudes as the scientist the danger is when the science becomes a belief when we get into scientism which is not the same thing when we made the mistake of shifting over as if four is over on the upper right we have the the the builder the engineer we're solving different problems we're resolving uniqueness rather try to force things to fit and we also got the artist creating the new ideas now we have to be able to move between each of these dynamically it's not that one is better than another it's possibly true that one is better dynamically for one purpose than another which is an issue we'll come on to all the next video but overall we need all of those modes at some point during the development and production of anything in a business so look at these different modes the artist looking at inner value the believer looking at in a truth the the scientist looking at the truth in the outer world the built or engineer looking at out of volume the usefulness of things rather than arguing about the truth so it's a useful little model to map out what we need dynamically which mindsets we need dynamically because if we don't get the right one at the right time that's when things start to go wrong and we'll look at that in the next video thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to
