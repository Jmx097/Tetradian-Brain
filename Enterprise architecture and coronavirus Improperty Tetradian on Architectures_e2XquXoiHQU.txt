in the previous video in this series on an enterprise architecture view on the corona virus pandemic I talked about anti property the the wastage and the the losses the the way that the any waste is offloaded on to other people and therefore the costs of dealing with that they're offloaded on to other people as well if you don't like to look at another idea that relates to that which is the concept of in property we talk about property if something that is proper to people that it is actually property that which is proper but I'm beginning to suspect that more than just suspect the data is really there that there's a huge problem that we have with what we might call in property where property becomes accumulated or acquired or taken from others to the extended it becomes socially and more completely improper so property is that which is proper in property is that which is improper now when we look at this on a societal scale looking at it historically there are two very clear factors that contribute to or even drive societal collapse and they are climate change and it disparity of income disparity of wealth those two will drive a collapse in put together they certainly will now in other starkly for seven thousand years this is a very clear closely track there's no question of us at all so just how big is this problem of in property but one example that came up in the news the other day was a on our company which was in trouble its Bank its most senior executives assigned themselves fourteen million dollars in bonuses and then declared the company bankrupt so they'd literally stolen the money from all of its creditors as well as assigning themselves money that simply wasn't appropriate at all so we also look at things like what is the global wealth disparity that is party overall well when we look at society at the excircles economics we find that one hundred people the billionaires in above actually control more than 3.5 billion people they control them a person can control Mel more than many governments and yet what are they doing with that but the drivers for this very much in the way the economics works that in the notes is the nature of a possession economy that money or resources will go naturally to worse worth at least needed they will flee from wherever they're most needed so we have to build this huge superstructure the banks insurances patients benefits taxes whatever to try to time shift resources to where they're actually needed the other one is that the money system can go to infinity and so growth is measured in monetary terms doesn't tell us anything at all about how that economics is actually working all it tells us is that the money system has grown but we cannot have infinite growth on a finite planet it's just simply not viable it's not sustainable it doesn't make sense so the fundamentals of our entire economics don't work and they naturally drive towards creating disparities that cause societal collapse and inability to respond to major changes or make changes such as climate or disease so we look at the other area in property what is proper what is not proper and it can be very useful to start applying an enterprise architecture toolkit to start looking at these issues not just within our own companies which is going to be important in itself the huge disparities that often exist within organizations but also but the much larger scale right up to the scale tire planet and entire economics these are the issues that were actually facing and we need to be considering this idea of what's proper what is not proper what is property what is in property I think that's worth an idea an idea that's worth exploring
