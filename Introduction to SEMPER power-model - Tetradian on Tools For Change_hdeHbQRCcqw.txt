in this video we'll look at a tool called simper which is a way to map out power issues within the organization the fundamental dichotomy we're looking at here is that the physics definition of power is the ability to do work whereas most social definitions power is the ability to avoid work they realize some very interesting problems from the organization's perspective so on the model we have in the middle that kind of yellow band is a kind of neutral and mid-range looking above what we're building increased responsibilities R increased choice to work with power and in below the line we have dysfunction both passive and active avoiding of work and a spiraling avoiding of work so looking upward power is seen as the ability to do work people gain value real value from just doing the work itself we all know that when we've done something well it feels good looking downward with this spiral the ability to avoid work the trouble is that if we avoid work then the work that needs to get done doesn't get done and so often there's a desire to prevent others from working too in mix in case it makes them look bad so even let's get work gets done it tends to be highly addictive so the classic answer to this is to put some kind of Massenet in charge to try to take control to make sure that needed work happens the trouble is that that immediately sets off a reaction it sets up passive dysfunction it's not my job mate I'm avoiding work I'm offloading responsibility onto the other so we end up with it's not my job down tools it particularly happens if people see it as unfair and not work is addictive this avoidance of work is addictive because no actual work gets done so that drags others down into active dysfunction and because it's addictive it goes from bad to worse there's a blame spiral everyone blaming everyone else for things not happening and it be slowly moves too propping self up by putting other down it then spirals even further if we're not careful into really bad the kind of situation where the police are called in so that's when the martinet and the regulator demand to take control and everyone gets lined up but if you're kind of an internal military-style command and control someone telling us what to do and everyone is watched and controlled and measured but again that spirals down particularly when we get the regulator involved who's trying to force everything from the outside which is the kind of double layer of forcing so it spirals down all over again and we see this so often in business environments but behind that there are people who want to do the work workers get engaged particularly when comes out of people understanding difference a simple example example of this perhaps is economics allowing for difference allowing for different perspectives using the fact of different perspectives is often a way to break through a lot of log jams we need us to need a much more human boss rather than a martinet to help build balance to help bring it back if people get fully engaged with that diversity we start getting people who will take it to a further stage that further stage is what we might call wholeness responsibility there's a feeling of I am the company I am responsible for everything that happens here but whole responsibility is really important is where huge power happens but it's often hard to maintain given all the pressures to pull us back in particular we need some kind of vision or continuity to main to help us maintain that wholeness we need to in fact need vision as a guide anywhere above command and control but the regulator will want command and control because they're afraid of us falling back the result of them of being afraid of us falling back is that we go right there way back to active dysfunction again it can break down everything that's going on force it all the way down and we lose all the value from people being committed to the work so the boss really has a choice we've got to keep the regulator at bay but we need vision to lift the value of the work up to keep your people committed to power as the ability to do the work all we're going to be fire fighting against active dysfunction people propping themselves up by putting others down so they're kind of line up we can see here going all the way from a kind of police to control the things going really bad to a the rules-based structure the kind of military style of everyone has defined roles and everyone is performing to that defined measures we've got this mid-level command and control we've got the supporting difference in variants and the importance of vision to really lift people up into wanting to do the work we're also going to balance the external demand of the regulator who always wants command and control which risks pulling everything down so power is the ability to do work or is it power is the ability to avoid work that's what we're mapping with semper and from they're able to start designing in interventions to move from one move upward in the scale thanks for watching do look at the youtube description for links to further detail and don't forget to
