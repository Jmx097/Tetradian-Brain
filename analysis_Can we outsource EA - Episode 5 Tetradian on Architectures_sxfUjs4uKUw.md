# Analysis: Can we outsource EA? - Episode 5, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
Enterprise Architecture (EA) cannot be outsourced as it is an ongoing organizational practice requiring internal ownership, personal responsibility, and contextual understanding, not a one-off project. External consultants can assist by documenting elements, building internal skills and maturity, and challenging groupthink, but the core work must remain in-house.

## Key Takeaways
- EA is a pervasive practice and everyone's responsibility throughout the organization, akin to strategy, demanding long-term internal ownership.
- Avoid consultancies promising to "do your architecture" entirely, as they can only document content, not embody true architecture.
- Consultants' value lies in developing organizational capability to manage complexity, fostering practices for purposeful integration, and providing an external perspective against biases like "not invented here."
- Outsourcing EA fully fails because it ignores local context, personal relationships, and sustained accountability.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Reject full outsourcing offers**: If a consultancy claims they will handle your entire EA, disengage immediately to protect organizational control.
- **Engage consultants strategically**: Use them to build internal skills—focus on maturity development for handling complexities and interconnections, as EA connects everything in the enterprise scope.[1]
- **Leverage consultants for bias-checking**: Employ external views to counter groupthink and insular thinking, enhancing overall architectural effectiveness.
