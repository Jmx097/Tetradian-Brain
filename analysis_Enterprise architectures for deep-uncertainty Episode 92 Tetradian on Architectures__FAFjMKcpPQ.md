# Analysis: Enterprise architectures for deep-uncertainty: Episode 92, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video discusses enterprise architectures tailored for chaotic, extreme situations like the coronavirus pandemic, emphasizing whole-enterprise approaches beyond just IT to address people, emotions, and rapid decision-making. It highlights the need to minimize guilt and blame, support knowledge transfer from senior to junior staff, identify predictable resource fragments amid chaos, and rethink fragile just-in-time systems in real-time.[4]

## Key Takeaways
- **Whole-enterprise architecture** is essential for chaos, focusing on people issues more than IT alone, including emotional support to enable fast decisions without guilt or blame.[1][3]
- Support emotionally difficult decisions with information systems that aid rather than hinder, as exemplified by the Walmart CEO's Hurricane Katrina response urging staff to act with limited, imperfect information.[4]
- Prepare for senior leaders' vulnerability (e.g., higher risk in pandemics) via shadowing mechanisms to transfer knowledge quickly to younger staff, akin to traditional secretaries carrying secrets.[4]
- Identify small predictable fragments in chaos, such as resource locations and risks, to enable rapid mobilization and expose hidden vulnerabilities in designs like just-in-time logistics.[4][6]
- Architectures must adapt in real-time to deep uncertainty, moving beyond linear models to handle uniqueness, emotional factors, and inevitable system breakdowns.[2][3]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Decision-making support**: Empower staff to make high-level decisions with incomplete information by designing systems that provide real-time visibility into resources, risks, and locations for quick redeployment—do the best with available data and prioritize action over perfection.[4]
- **Shadowing for succession**: Implement mechanisms where junior staff shadow seniors to learn decision patterns, ensuring continuity if leaders are sidelined; test these in simulations for crises like pandemics.[4]
- **Risk mapping in chaos**: Map predictable "fragments" (e.g., resource stockpiles, personnel availability) amid uncertainty; review and fortify supply chains like just-in-time models against single-point failures by building redundancy buffers.[4]
- **Emotional design**: Architect processes to minimize blame—e.g., post-event reviews focused on learning, not guilt—to speed up responses; integrate emotional awareness into enterprise-wide training for turbulent scenarios.[4][3]

## Quotes
- "This organization will respond rise to the level of this disaster many of you are going to have to make decisions well above your level you're going to have to make those decisions with very limited and often wrong information do the best you can with the information that you have available and do the right thing as best you can."[4]
- "We have to be able to work with [guilt] rather than hide from it."[4]
- "Who is shadowing them who knows what decisions those people make what kind of shadowing mechanism or body mechanism do you have for collecting these more senior people to younger people very much like the old idea of a secretary with someone who carried your secrets."[4]
- "Even in the midst of chaos there are usually small fragments or small areas that actually are quite predictable we need for example to know where our resources are."[4]
