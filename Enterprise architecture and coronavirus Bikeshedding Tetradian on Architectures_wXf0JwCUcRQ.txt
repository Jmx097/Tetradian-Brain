one thing that's become very clear over the last few weeks and months now is that coronaviruses bringing some major changes to the way we look at the world from a business perspective social but also much larger scale as well it's going to cause permanent damage or permanent change to quite a few industries oil and aviation already being two of the ones that are really obvious already but it's also bringing up some really global scale issues about just how dysfunctional our current economic model is when some people almost arbitrarily are out of work because that type of work isn't essential in NATO in a coronavirus or involves too many people being mixed together such as theaters or cinemas or certain types of shopping malls people in those industries are suddenly for no fault of their own all being laid off in very very large numbers so suddenly people are finding themselves with no income but still have to pay their mortgage and still have all of their their days what are their costs so this what we're showing us is that the economics are simply doesn't work we need to do a fundamental rethink of economics going forward as well not just some businesses but what I've talked about this in some of the previous videos a lot of people have had some really useful comments but some I've been frankly appalled but the really poor quality of the responses people coming back with quality of analysis that if they try to apply to the business would destroy that business what they would certainly be fired fairly quickly for doubt the damage that they're doing - or normalization and yet when faced with a larger scope issue they're resorting to really shallow very narrow focus short term or else in some cases one particular one in particular came with back with a chunk of standard ideology whenever were pointed out this was unexamined ideology and to examine it because of the scope of change he simply doubled down on the ideology this is just not going to work long term and the scope is actually a scope error and the term for that kind of scope error is bike shedding you'll find it on Wikipedia by the way it's one of their warnings about how to address editing issues on Wikipedia because it comes from a lovely story actually fictional but it's illustrating real world by C Northcote Parkinson but he wrote the book Parkinson's Law he talked about it I commit here which had three agenda items the first was deciding on what to do about a new the build of a nuclear power station the second item was about what color the ancestral structure the bike sheds should be and the third was an eye on a discussion about expenses for refreshments during meeting the nuclear power station they covered in four and a half minutes they discipline did a random decision because it was way outside of their ability to make decisions so they're just simply guessed the bike shed they spent 40 minutes arguing about exactly the bits and pieces and the final item leaks the discussion about the expenses and the refreshments they spent the entirety of the rest of the hour two hours of the meeting arguing about this and since they haven't come to decision deferred that to the next meeting so we've got an inverse scale of attention to the actual severity or seriousness of the problem and what's going on here is that people are answering to their level of understanding if they all understood what a bike shape was and if I had something to say to argue about it almost none of them actually understood the nuclear power station or anything about it and so they just simply skipped over it this is what's happening with many of the issues around coronavirus of we need to have discipline to get past this when we're faced with a major issue we can't just go in four-bike shitty we've actually got to make sure that we're answering at the proper level and that's where our discipline is coming and also where all of the work when fractality comes in because we're able to use the same tools at every scale that's why these tools about that work with context neutral where we and the context to it are so important because we're dealing with things that every possible scale but we need discipline around this the other thing we need to realize is that when the context is changing on us a lot of our previous knowledge a lot of our existing knowledge is actually no not so much no help but an active hindrance particularly when we're dealing with major change now one of the things that is getting to be quite scary in which people are avoiding like crazy there's that difficult as the coronavirus issues are affecting for the same right the way across the scale they're actually quite trivial by comparison with some of what's going on I use a scale of the myth quake scale which is essentially a powers of 10 about the numbers of lives changed in life changes are affected in life changing ways in the case of coronavirus we're talking about tens to hundreds of millions of people's lives being affected which is run the myth quake six to seven the range in powers of 10 but some of the things that we're facing now such as the fundamental fact that we can't have infinite growth on a finite planet and therefore an economics that depends on infinite growth is not viable in the long return that's one of the major issues that's certainly going to a mythical gate affecting billions of people so up to billions of people some of the climate change issues and some of the other issues that we're facing at that sort of scale are right up to extinction level if we don't tackle them now we don't have much time we need to practice on these supposedly hard issues of the corona virus in order to get ready for the much bigger ones that are coming our way we can't afford to hide in bike-sharing it will kill us all
