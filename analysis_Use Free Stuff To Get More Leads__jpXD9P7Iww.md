# Analysis: Use Free Stuff To Get More Leads

## Executive Summary
The video's core message is that offering discounted or free introductory services, such as a cheap massage, can attract more leads who are likely to convert into paying customers for the main, higher-priced offering. This lead magnet strategy leverages initial value to drive long-term revenue through package or subscription sales.

## Key Takeaways
- **Low-cost or free offers (lead magnets) attract more potential customers than immediately promoting core, high-priced services.**
- **A fraction of those responding to the free offer will convert to paying for the full service, resulting in higher overall customer acquisition.**
- **A lead magnet may have a cost or even operate at a loss, but the long-term value of converted customers justifies the upfront expense.**
- **Measuring conversion rates from lead magnet to core offer is crucial to determine the profitability of the approach.**
- **This strategy is standard and effective for service-based businesses seeking to increase their customer base.**

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Identify a **core service or product** that you want leads to eventually purchase (e.g., a massage package or subscription).
- Create a **low-cost, high-value offer** as your lead magnet (e.g., a $10 introductory massage).
- Present the lead magnet broadly to your target audience to increase participation (e.g., 100 people offered a $10 massage vs. $100).
- Track conversions: Of those who take the lead magnet offer, monitor how many upgrade to the full-priced package.
- Calculate acquisition cost: Even if you lose money on the initial offer (e.g., paying $20 in cost for a $10 massage), calculate if the revenue from converted customers (e.g., 6 out of 20 buy a $100 package) results in net profit.
- Use the results to optimize your lead magnet's price and promotion for maximum ROI[4][2][3].

## Quotes
- "**If I give away a $10 massage to get people to come in and then later everyone buys packages of massages from me or buys a massage subscription from me, the massage subscription or the massage packages are my core offer and the lead magnet would be the trial offer of the $10 or discounted massage.**"
- "**If I go up to 100 people and say hey let me give you a massage for $100 bucks, a lot of people might say no... if I then said I want to give you a massage for $10, I might get 20 people to say yes and then of those 20 get a third of them to buy the hundred thing after they tried my massage.**"
- "**So if it cost me $10 in cost to give the massage then I break even on my lead magnet. If it actually cost me $20, I might lose $10... but am I willing to lose $10 on 20 people so I pay $200 to get six customers that convert and are worth $2000.**"
