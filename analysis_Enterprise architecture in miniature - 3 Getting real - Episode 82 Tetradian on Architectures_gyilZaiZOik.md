# Analysis: Enterprise architecture in miniature - 3: Getting real - Episode 82, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
This episode advances the "enterprise architecture in miniature" series by shifting from conceptual context to practical scopes for a one-person digital nomad organization focused on a mobile EA learning-lab in a van. It emphasizes identifying best practices, viable business and operating models, development tasks, and minimum viable products (MVPs) at each stage to ensure the enterprise pays its way during build-out.[4][5]

## Key Takeaways
- Enterprise architecture principles apply identically to a single-person organization, using the van-life digital nomad setup as a demonstrator for teaching, documenting, and promoting whole-enterprise architecture.[1][4]
- Key scopes include best practices (e.g., business models via YouTube, financial reserves, live prototypes), equipment needs (cameras, utilities like water/power), and vehicle maintenance skills.[5]
- Business model starts with Business Model Canvas, expanding to Enterprise Canvas for services like idea-to-action planning sessions using tools such as SCORE, Holomap, and Service-Cycle.[1][5]
- Operating model leverages Enterprise Canvas for support services and value themes; development focuses on tool availability (e.g., SCORE, SCAN) and van build sequence with stage-specific MVPs tied to revenue.[5]
- Practical sessions (1-2 hours) can help clients understand strategic choices via EA tools, making it viable for small organizations.[5]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Business Model Development**: Start with **Business Model Canvas** to identify revenue streams (e.g., teaching, YouTube documentation/promotion, client engagement). Transition to **Enterprise Canvas** for service mapping, including idea-to-initial-action-plan workshops using **SCORE** (Strengths, Challenges, Options, Responses, Effectiveness) for strategy, **Holomap** for stakeholders/context, and **Service-Cycle** for service connections—deliverable in 1-2 hours.[1][5]
- **Operating Model**: Use **Enterprise Canvas** to map support services and value themes threading through processes.[5]
- **Van Build Sequence**: Sequence builds with **minimum usable products/services** at each stage (e.g., basic mobility for initial teaching gigs) to generate revenue progressively; assess tools (SCORE, SCAN), equipment (cameras, utilities), and maintenance needs.[5]
- **Best Practices Integration**: Build financial reserves via investment; create live prototypes; learn utilities (water, light, power, access) and vehicle maintenance on the road.[5]
