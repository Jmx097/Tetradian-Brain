# Analysis: A question of fitness - Episode 57, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video explores the concept of "fitness for purpose" in enterprise architecture and management, using fitness landscapes and seascapes to map how solutions like Agile, Lean, or Six Sigma perform across varying conditions. It emphasizes designing systems that account for both stable and changing variables, including uncertainty, rather than ignoring them. The discussion challenges the misuse of "survival of the fittest" by highlighting context-dependent fitness.

## Key Takeaways
- Fitness for purpose is assessed via **fitness landscapes**, which map how well solutions fit specific variables and conditions, showing some methods outperform others in different environments.
- Examples include **Agile/Lean** suiting dynamic, uncertain contexts, while **Six Sigma** or rigid **waterfall** approaches fit stable, controlled ones—mismatches lead to poor outcomes.
- Fitness evolves into a **fitness seascape** when variables change over time, requiring adaptation as ideal fits shift with conditions.
- Tools like **scan-about** help gauge proximity to real-time data and levels of uncertainty, including "uncertainty about uncertainty."
- Core principle: Design for **what changes and what doesn't**, embracing uncertainty instead of denying it.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Map your context using a **fitness landscape**: Identify key variables (e.g., stability, control needs, uncertainty levels) and plot methods like Agile vs. Six Sigma to select the best fit.
- Transition to a **fitness seascape** for dynamic environments: Monitor shifting variables over time and re-evaluate fitness periodically.
- Apply uncertainty tools: Use **scan-about** or similar to assess real-time closeness, uncertainty types, and meta-uncertainty, adjusting approaches accordingly.
- In governance or architecture: Avoid one-size-fits-all; test methods against current conditions (e.g., don't use Agile in highly stable settings).

## Quotes
- "What do we actually mean when we use that phrase [fitness for purpose] so the whole question about what Fitness means in a sense the real meaning behind that much misused phrase of the survival of the fittest."
- "We will map out what's known as a fitness landscape how well something fits the particular purpose in each of its different variables so what we're doing is we're mapping out that certain solutions are more fitter than others in different conditions."
- "The crucial point here is that in understanding fitness for purpose we need to design for what changes as well as what doesn't we need to design for uncertainty rather than pretend that the uncertainty doesn't exist."
