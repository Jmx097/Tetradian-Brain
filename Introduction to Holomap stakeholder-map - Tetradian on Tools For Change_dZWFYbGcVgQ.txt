who are our stakeholders what do they do what are their responsibilities their roles their relationships it can be an awful lot of them not more than we think and it's also useful to remember that a stakeholder is anyone who can will the sharp-pointed stake in our direction so we use a tool called the holomap to map the stakeholders set of different views the service itself the internals its transactions the direct interactions and the indirect interactions this helps us to place the stakeholders which clarifies what they do where they are what their relationship is with them and their relationships with each other so typically we'll start with the organization as the surface itself which doesn't have any stakeholders because it's the thing that stakeholders have relationships with within map the stakeholders in the organization's internal services the IT in more and we then map three layers outward from the organization the first is the enterprise of transaction with suppliers the whole supply chain the transactional work with customers and the rest now we look at the market who are stakeholders within the market such as recruiters and so on on direct interactions and finally we look at the indirect interactions with people who we don't interact generally with as such but they can have huge impacts on us now so far this has been kind of abstract so kind of yawn so let's make it come alive let's add the human dimension with some simple minifigures we start off with the organization as a whole that kind of us represented here by a manager sitting in that position of the organization for somewhere down in IT with the rated relationship between IT and the business we might think that their business is the only stakeholder that matters but actually we're going to need to have a whole lot of other services that we relate with who might also be stakeholders there's facilities there's accounts there's production there's planning there's engineering all in addition to what we've seen with just the IT and remember these may be under our direction but they're never truly under our control that distinction is important now we look at the immediate supply chain the obvious ones like supplier and customer but we actually need to think much more much more broadly about not just the supplier but the suppliers supplier not just the customer but the customers customer and also any prospects supplier prospects and customer prospect when only to look at the stakeholders in the broader broader market there are our competitors of course everyone thinks about those but there's also the regulator's there's recruiters there's journalists those analysts those trainers there's many others all of these they don't interact with us on the main supply chain but they do have direct interactions with us beyond that there's a kind of shared story these are people who interact only indirectly at times but can have huge impact on us things like the infrastructure and other broadcast scope services that keep our business going there's the families in the community the families of our employees the families of our customers have everyone else there's government there's politics that's what's happening in other countries to them the ones who are doing that can change the whole story on us there's the big picture the observers of the whole story people who are keeping track of how well we keep our promises there are the anti clients the people who believe we've already broken our promises and who will work very hard to prevent us keeping our business and there are hackers and other criminals who just want to make money or make destruction for the sake of it these are indirect in stakeholders but we need to be aware of them the cookers this their stakes can be very sharp so when we look at the whole of the enterprise the whole space there are a lot of interactions a lot of stakeholders so we started with the organization of service we took the classic IT centric view we expanded it out to internal services IT and more we looked at the immediate and direct in transactions and the whole transaction web we then looked at stakeholders in the market the direct interactions that we have and there did the shared story stakeholders the indirect interaction so we start looking at this in terms of the switch with that without any stakeholders just ourselves but we need to include all of the internal services who might be stakeholders we need to add the internal plus the transaction stakeholders we need to add the direct interaction the mark the stakeholders from the market in the market space we need to add those from the overall story the whole enterprise stakeholders internal transaction direct interaction indirect interaction so we use the holomap to map these stakeholders for the organization as a whole or we can use it in another way just for any service by placing that one service as the center and mapping out word from there so we use the holomap term help make sense of stakeholders their roles their relationships their responsibilities and their interactions with us that's what the holomap helps us to do thanks for watching do look at the youtube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
