how do we support situational awareness within enterprise architecture under weaves enterprise architecture this was a question that was posed to me by several people particularly Alan Lloyd and Alec Blair one suggest is a useful metaphor of the invisible armies if we look at an army it has lots of physical stuff and nowadays it has lots of information but we also need to look at the relationships between people and the sense of purpose that connects them all together so we need to connect all of these invisible armies as well as the visible stuff and visible actions that we see for this this two german terms two classic german military terms that are really useful here one of them is Alf Trucks tactic and the other is finger spits in Gifu Alf cracks tactic is about distributed decision-making that the people at the frontline need to have the the information that they need our need to be able to make the decisions based on local circumstances this is where we get the idea of commander's intent rather than rigid instructions we want to have the intention the outcome that we're looking at how you get there has to be decided locally and it also has to be connected to purpose because if we don't have connection to purpose what we get to use staff at beers famous phrase or term is what we get is posi wid the purpose of the system is what it does if we want to have an actual purpose that we choose rather than just simply arises when you'd have clarity on what purpose is to help guide our decision-making the other side of this is finger spit simcha fuel which literally translates as fingertip sensitivity or fingertip feeling which is actually what we mean really by situational awareness because without connection to reality decisions are made on assumptions and guesswork this is simply not a good idea so we pick up information we pass it around to other people building a sense across the whole not just in our own area of the fingertip feel of what's going on we can't pass it through a rigid hierarchy upwards and back down because it's too slow in real time real time action what we have to do is to feed it gently up there and feed it gently back so that we can still adapt our Franks tactic adapting destroyed distributed decisions so an example here for Anna larger-scale will be something like Woodley Maps well we start building a feel for how we how the technology is changing how we move from initial experimentation to bespoke to off the peg to commodity that all of the technologies gently shift in that direction we need the special source to do the bits that are differentiate us from others but as far as practicable we want to build those special sources on top of commodity services that are easily available so we spread the information around we use something like Wardley maps to build a picture of what the landscape is like and as it is dynamically changing so a building situational awareness at the big picture scale as well as the low pictures go so our architecture must support all of our invisible armies the connections between people to the connection to purpose the connection being made with information going back down to the physical actions so things like big data big things like in Internet of Things all of these do come into the picture here but they don't come before they don't dominate we need to understand what the picture is in order to build the situational awareness when these new sensors and new tools
