in the last episode I talked a bit about shadow IG and shadow generally shadow business model shadow management even and why we actually do need it to happen in the business environment but the next point is how do we learn from it how do we use it and there's a phrase I use here called which is agility needs a backbone if you think of a cheetah then you've got a very fast running animal it can sprint really fast and turn really well because it has a backbone to leverage from to work against now the backbone is actually central to the whole organization and its relationship with the shared enterprise if the backbone changes if there's something in the backbone it's actually a different enterprise the backbone the core of what's right out of the core of the organization needs to be completely stable like a backbone the edge but even if that it's stable the edge can move around as much as it likes in order to adapt to changing conditions now the things we need in the backbone are things like purpose values core assets like data core data the single single source of truth that is central to every shared service we want to have the things the essential assets also things like rights the right to do something the right to access to particular types of assets these are central some methods may be considered central but they're kind of a secret source the central the core things that we bring to the shared enterprise but things like the IT hardware and legacy MIT legacy systems ready are this has a lot of implications when we talk about things like cloud because there's no reason why we shouldn't move around between different types of providers as long as we control the data itself the data is part of the backbone so when we look at rules to move around move things in and out we've got stuff out on the edge the experiments the new stuff the new ideas we've got stuff in the middle that is being worked on that is being used backburn for a different particular department around the organization as a whole and then there's the actual backbone the things that really must not change but in a sense this also gives us an idea of the difference between governance because the backbone really needs to be waterfall tight governments we really do need it to be very stable and to change only with the utmost care whereas out on the edge we need things to be as agile as possible and we're going to be using an agile type development an agile type governance to govern what's going on there but there is a place in the middle it's not just bimodal in fact it's multimodal Ward Lee's idea of pioneers settler and town planner where the pioneers are out experimenting the settlers are making it real and continued into practice and the town planners are keeping things everything's stable we need these distinctions so we have a mode for bringing stuff in from the edge into the middle to be worked on to be made usable by everyone and then it becomes cool and slowly some things move out of the core as well so agility needs a backbone but we need to move things into and out of that backbone over time as the needs of the business change
