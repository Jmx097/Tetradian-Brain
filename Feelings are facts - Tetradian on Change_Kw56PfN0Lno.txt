another useful idea to explore is that feelings of facts whereas opinions and beliefs about feelings are not facts so many people seem to get this one the wrong way around that what we feel we have no choice about if we feel afraid we feel afraid if we feel strong we feel strong that doesn't necessarily mean that we are strong that we are powerful that we are whatever we need to understand that those feelings are facts in their own right and that we need to work with them i've done quite a bit of work in the violence space violence resolution space and one of the themes that we promote or push very strongly there is that what you feel what you perceive is your own truth it's not necessarily anyone else's and the only person who can actually change that the only person is responsible for changing those feelings is ourselves we can't offload it to someone else we can be responsible about someone else we can be responsible to someone else but we cannot be for someone else the only responsibility resides with us in that very deep sense of working on feelings or working on fears i remember a rally once where people were demanding they said we demand the right to walk the streets at night without the fear of rape now the sentiment obviously i have no question with whatsoever but the trouble is i can't actually stop you being afraid if you are afraid there's nothing i can do if you're caught in a fear loop particularly when the fear is essentially addictive it's a an awfulization loop so i can't do anything that will guarantee that you won't feel afraid i might produce circumstances where you do and where you don't don't but demanding that others produce circumstances where only you do not feel afraid doesn't actually help anyone including you because in a sense it's requiring that we take responsibility from you for those feelings which then emphasizes that you are then feel powerless which will re-feed the fear the same is true someone who walks around with for example brandishes a gun to threaten someone it doesn't actually solve the fear that the person wielding the gun is holding it might increase the fear in the other person but that doesn't actually help to resolve anything at all so once we realize that feelings are facts and are personal that gives us an option to shift an obvious place to move a place where we can make things happen so feelings of facts opinions and beliefs about fears about feelings are not facts it's a really useful shift to make when we're dealing with change
