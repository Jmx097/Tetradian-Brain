this one's from Tom Nook who asks or comments that teams appear to rely more on developers than architects these days could you analyze this trend and separate the fluffy hype from the nuggets of valuable insight well perhaps the most useful point here is that there's a common error in assuming that architecture is only big design up front and therefore not relevant to the kind of dynamic iterative processes that develop up devops and developer operation relationships need to make the crucial distinction here is that architecture innocent in essence looks upward towards the big picture whereas design looks downward towards making it real but they're always the same thing it's just flip sides of the same coin the what we need here is just enough architecture a great big design up front is unhelpful but we need we do need just enough to make sure everything connects to the big picture otherwise what we can do is go rushing off in one direction there then another direction there in another direction there another direction there and nothing connects up what we need from architecture is the key decisions about what's going to be expensive to change expensive in terms of not just money but also time in terms of technology in terms of future operational costs in terms of that trade-off between capex and OPEX all those kind of key decisions that are very difficult to change if we get them wrong so we need an understanding of the big picture regardless of where we are in the detail we need to look upward sometimes to the architecture level to the big picture level to understand how this connects with everything else in essence what we need is not so much DevOps as octopops a complete continuous connection all the way through from big picture to real world and back again
