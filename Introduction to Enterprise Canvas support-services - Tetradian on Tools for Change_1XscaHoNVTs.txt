in the previous video we talked about enterprise canvas a service model a model of how services work as a kind of checklist of how our service works together as a whole in this video what to look at how various support services work in relation to a given service remember that if we think of this as the service as a whole then we can divide it in terms of what happens before during and after a major activity a transaction for example and value creation in this case and then stuff that is about stuff going out and on the other side's about things coming in the interactions that are coming there so if we look at it as a whole there are classically a bunch of Direction services or guidance services that talk about how we are going to direct this given service so it's derived from a classic model called viable system model which you you may or may not know but it's worth looking up I'll include a link on that in the description box in the YouTube description so for any given service there are three timescales that we're dealing with which roughly speaking break down to strategy tactic tactics and operations so if we break this into three parts this is what's classically considered to be management there is line management which were is about runtime is about management of operations there is management about the tactics about what we're going to do in the future rather than what's happening right now so as a tactical operation which is also about looking at the outside world so I'll look at looking outside there's operations which is looking mostly inside and there's also strategy which is about it's about identity and purpose and wealth we talked in the previous one about values values are what are derived from identity and purpose and they're the things that guide strategy so this is the direction services they provide direction for whatever service were on at different time scales now as a service operates it's going to need some kind of coordination so we have another group of services that are the coordination services and again there are three sets of these that deal with runtime coordination about the connection between the running of the service itself and the operations running which again is giving us the connection outside particularly it's the coordination of what happens in relation to those interactions that we saw before about what happens before during and after so that's dealing with those coordination points here about how we connect to someone else and onward to someone else there's also so that's the runtime coordination then we have coordination of change which is classically for example the project management office or anything else that's dealing with the process of change itself so that's going to coordinate between operations and tactics it's helping getting the information from the tactics to help change and the third one is about is again change of strategy a strategic change which connects is a bridge provides a coordination of bridge between strategy and tactics so that's typically the portfolio management office or things like enterprise architecture but again these are dealing with connections to others particularly this is looking outside this is looking inside this is looking at the runtime issues so on another side we have a whole bunch of services that deal with quality I call them the validation services but the crucial thing to realized is it's how are we going to manage quality and we have a larger number of support and validation there we may have a very large number of these services like secure service for security services for quality services for environment services for safety every time we have some kind of qualitative concern we're going to have one of these so there could be quite a lot of them and these again split in different ways these DIF the first one is why is it important so it's build awareness that the quality is important and that's often things like posters and so on but also just engaging people there is build capability to enact that's the capability to enact to support that quality so I do actions at runtime to make sure that I'm keeping on track to purpose other than keeping on track to that qualitative construction certain and the other one is continuous review and improve so whenever we finish an action and there's a another video about this about after-action review whenever we do an action we need to review against the qualitative concerns so these again they connect somewhat with each of these musti for coordination of doing training coordination of of connections to the purpose particularly they're connecting to the strategic and identity because that's where those concerns come from these are interacting with stress strategic change and these can occur or coordinate at runtime but the review is particularly happening after that's building the before connect making sure that before is connected capability is making sure that it's going to happen at runtime so we're building awareness building capability building and reviewing and improving continuously on the basis of what's happening here and as I say everyone every qualitative concern safety security but sustainability financial probity ethics said security many many others depending on what the industry is what the concerns will be those are covered by things like standards which is how we're going to review them so there are a whole bunch of support services in relation to our main service we also have another group of support services particularly about investor and beneficiary now investors are not necessarily monetary for example if you're working for a company then the company is an investor in your family otherwise you're not going to be available for the company to work in the company likewise your family is an investor in your place in the company it's interesting in that the flow if it's monetary flow it's like a customer but it goes the like a supplier but it goes the opposite direction and in the same way for a beneficiary it's like a customer but it goes in the opposite direction it's coming in to it and these are connecting particularly with value governance to make sure that it's balanced and fair if we don't have it balanced and fair it will break it was a very common cause of failure in organizations and a classic example of that is where everyone is investing anyone in a community is investing in a company but all the money is transferred only to the financial investors that's a classic cause of complete failure for an organization so whenever we look at a service if the core of the service and each one of them is split up in multiple ways so each one of these services within service every given service must have these support services in order for that for that for that service to be viable it needs direction it needs coordination it needs validation it's likely to need investors and it's likely to have beneficiaries who are supported by that service in a way that is different from the basic value flow so overall if you if we saw in the previous video about how Enterprise campus provides a checklist for services themselves this provides a checklist for how what all the supports verses are that are required to create viability so this provides a viability checklist for any service if these aren't here then that service will fail so we need to understand what these services all are how they interrelate with this services and their jur they are support services not control services this is a fundamental issue that a lot of people think management is it about control well it's just another support service thanks for watching do look at
