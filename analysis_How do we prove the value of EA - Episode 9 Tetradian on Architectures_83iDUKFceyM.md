# Analysis: How do we prove the value of EA? - Episode 9, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
Proving the value of enterprise architecture (EA) requires demonstrating how elements work better together holistically, rather than relying solely on isolated KPIs or metrics. Real-world examples from Australia Post illustrate this through integrating small projects into larger initiatives and creating widely adopted functional business models that managers actively use.

## Key Takeaways
- Traditional KPIs or metrics are insufficient in practice to prove EA value; instead, show purposeful integration and synergy across projects and capabilities.
- A seemingly valueless project (e.g., REO tracking mail truck contents) gained millions in value when repositioned within broader efforts like rostering, scheduling, and logistics.
- Building a multi-tiered functional business model (abstract, industry-specific, organization-specific with ~250 capabilities) with overlays for information, projects, and costing proves value when managers adopt and display it.
- Visible adoption by stakeholders—such as managers printing and using architecture models on walls—serves as strong evidence of delivered value.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Examine small or rejected projects in the context of ongoing major initiatives; rework connections to unlock hidden value, using discretionary budgets to facilitate integration.
- Develop a tiered capability map: Layer 1 (universal), Layer 2 (industry-specific, e.g., logistics), Layer 3 (organization-specific); add overlays for information flows, projects, activity-based costing.
- Use architecture tools or diagrams to trace interdependencies; demonstrate value through stakeholder behavior, like theft of models for daily use.

## Quotes
- "our KPIs or just metrics just enough in practice the answer is no what we really need is to prove particularly by showing how things do work better together and on purpose"
- "suddenly that little valueless project and is something like several million dollars worth of value to these other projects by looking at how it worked as a whole"
- "when managers steal your own work in architecture you know that you've got value delivered"
