there's a theme about the corona virus pandemic that I'm seeing developing in quite a few countries now about rules and responsibilities the theme that I people seem to forget particularly it seems politicians is that the rules are not necessarily set by people the foundations for those rules are set by the virus itself it's not just something we can casually ignore it's not something we can control it's about how the virus operates it's why the importance of science in all of these spaces but politics seems to be coming into this in some quite nasty ways and we need to be thinking much more carefully about we and what we actually mean by rules why and what aware the foundation of an organization is we learn in enterprise architecture is that it's bounded by rules roles and responsibilities that we have roles to enact rules and we have responsibilities to each other to make it work is that to each other that's so important because the fundamental problem we keep seeing is that breaking the rules we have the whole issue of what we might call the free-rider problem which is basically other people can follow the rules I'll do what the hell the hell I like now you can do that to some extent in a politics derived environment but you can't do it in a virus dominated environment the rules are not ones that we can casually break but rules are essentially social there we first if you like that about responsibilities to each other wearing a mask isn't not necessarily about protecting yourself it's actually about protecting others look there was Rose the free-rider is focused primarily on the self the me first approach rather than the we first the problem is that Free Riders break trust in social rules the more that the individuals ignore the rules the more it implies that the rules don't matter and that's a very dangerous position to be because it places everyone at risk now this particularly applies if those who set the rules particularly politicians and others those who set the rules do not themselves follow the rules that's one of the quickest ways to destroy mutual trust across a societal context but we see the same issue arising with organizations organizations have a very high tendency because they're so rule-bound it's a very high tendency for the free-rider problem to raise its head we see a lot of this and things like one-sided terms and current conditions which are they like to find it useful to be to reframe as trusts and commitments it's not helpful to think of it as a control mechanism but we are controlling others for now our benefit it also leads to things like dysfunctional hierarchies a problem sometimes described as in super ordination where the manager is has no understanding of what's going on in breaking their responsibilities to the staff who are within the reporting demand so it's inserting we need to understand insubordination in context of in super ordination in order to understand how it works responsibilities are always mutual and they always need interlocks checks and balances so when as in occurred recently in Britain where a certain political adviser flaunted the rules that he himself made and then proceeded to mock everyone else for complaining that he broken them this destroyed trust almost totally and the result is going to be there were very large numbers of people not just a few people but very large numbers of people are likely to die as are in very nasty ways as a result of the destruction of trust so these are absolutely non-trivial but the same issues our client not only in organisations but society as a whole where we have one-sided rules as in that case where the political class are entitled to ignore the rules whereas everyone else must follow them for the safety of the political class as well as everyone else we have it in structures which define some people as subordinate as some people have rights others have responsibilities particular class or whatever basis on a category basis so we need to be really careful because we're we have the free rider problem running unchecked it leads to institutionalized theft or life theft it leads to institutionalized abuse in some cases even to institutionalized violence these are not good things to have as a structure so we need to be really careful about seeing how rules are great and ensuring that everyone accepts their responsibility that goes with those rules why those rules exist
