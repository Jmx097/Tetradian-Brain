Pat Ferdinand II asks me to describe how I understand the meaning of the term enterprise which is a rather important term if we're talking about enterprise architecture well to me the enterprise is the context in which the organization operates in effect it's a kind of story a set of relationships of interactions of drivers and that provides the space in which the organization must behave must agree to must act within the way to describe this is a kind of build from described as a holomap because of the way it works so it looks as that a whole we ask first what does anything happen and the short answer is that something happens because there's a tension between what we have and what we want we then create our own services or own means of reaching towards that goal that also means that we can in doing so we can not only help others reach towards their goals but others can help too can reach help us reach towards ours so that provides the first layer of service the next layer out is what we might call the market it's where our prospects limits where our competitors live it's also where the regulator's live it's the journalists the recruiters the the market specialists and the people who build the rules and regulations on which the the organization of the market itself runs beyond that there's a much broader space a kind of indirect interactions of communities that we live in of of the investors the the beneficiaries the families of the employees the families of customers and so on so there's a broader space all the way out it's all held together as a kind of story for example that's my story I mean something like the tagline of Ted was it Technology Entertainment Design which is ideas worth spreading everyone in that whole space is concerned in some way with ideas worth spreading so one of the things to understand is that for this purpose organization and enterprise are not the same things they're two different entities or two different spaces that can coincide but an organization is bounded by rules roles and responsibilities whereas an enterprise is bounded by vision by values and commitments if we say that the organization is the enterprise then it's essentially talking to itself and thus has no reason to exist really as an organization so we need to have this broader space and typically we say that we're going to we look at an an enterprise that is three steps out from the organization the organization itself then each transaction space its direct interaction space and is in direct interaction space all linked together by the same story so when we build an architecture an enterprise architecture we build an architecture for an organization but it needs to be about the enterprise in which it operates otherwise it has no means to describe how its operating or what the drivers are so organization and enterprise are not the same it's really important that we don't mix them up
