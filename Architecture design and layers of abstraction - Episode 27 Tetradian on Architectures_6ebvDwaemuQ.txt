in this episode we bring together two related questions one from Eric Weinstein who asks about the extended Zachman layering well the extended Zachman framework and Joe Chittenden who asks about the relationship between architecture and design of what are they how do they differ which is actually the most popular question on my blog we can explain both of these by looking at the extended leg exactement layering a-class exactement has five distinct layers from some big picture down to implementation what we've added in the extension is the whole enterprise something that never changes or should never change and also a kind of action record layer where we transition from the future into the past things that we can't change all of the other five layers are about the things that we can change so architecture in essence looks upward to big-picture to new options to repurpose and reuse and also Moret if you like the Y and the Humber who of the of the overall implicit implementation designed looks downward towards realisation towards implementation more at the how and the what when and where in effect when we get to the real world the moment of the now we have to have a complete set of who what when where how and why things are usable to the extent that their architectural II complete in that sense whereas things are reusable to the extent that they're incomplete so we move up and down the stack all the time so at each point in that stack architecture looks upward design looks downward so that for example from the top end of the stack everything else looks like design from the bottom of the stack everything else looks like architecture in the middle architecture looks upward design looks down we keep on repeating at the same layer of the stack the other point is that each of these layers each of those views the architecture is about the big decisions that are expensive to fix later or that we may not be able to fix at all if we get them wrong so architecture helps us to connect with the big picture and make sure we don't settle for its expensive mistakes we bring them together into the whole so architecture and designer always flip sides of each other you can't have one without the other and the way the way it works is depends on which way we're looking from each stage as we move from the future towards the now and into the past so that's how the layering works there's layers of abstraction architecture and design look upward and downward from each as we go through
