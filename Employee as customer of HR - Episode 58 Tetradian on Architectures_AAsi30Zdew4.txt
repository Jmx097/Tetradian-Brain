the Belgian Enterprise Architect maxi McClelland recently reminded me of an old blog post of mine about employee as customer of HR well the practical problems we have when doing business architectures and even enterprise architectures at the IT level is the old taylora Stata tube that a customer has seen is really not much more than a walking wallet and an employee is little more than a box of desirable characteristics which is what a job description typically is it doesn't actually look at the person as person both of in both cases the employee and the customer they're viewed as possessed assets but the catch here is that people are not assets it is the relationship with the person that is the asset because without that relationship we don't have connection to the person so that the phrase about people are not assets you need in fact the only time when people are assets is when they're slaves so if we think of people as assets this is not a good idea perhaps particularly with employees so the employee relationship is very similar to a customer relationship to sales and marketing for example we have a prospect employee do they match up with our story do they have needs that match our needs what are the prospects what are the things that make that person our perspective how do we interview them is very similar to a sales connection with a current employee it's very much like an ongoing customer with an ex-employee did you do an exit interview did you find out why your customer left did you find out why your employee left can you maintain relationships with customers like in a CRM system so that they might come back some very interesting organizations actually have alumni organizations for their ex employ EES we also have to be concerned just as we have to be concerned about Auntie clients and Auntie customers people hyung who are no longer connected but who are committed against our organization they don't trust our organization anymore the equivalent is the anti employee look at the bad reviews of the organization's on Glassdoor for example you'll see a lot of anti employees there people who were employees and no longer will be the customer relationship with HR has been broken we also need to look at things like presenteeism not just absenteeism website one doesn't turn up but presenteeism is very similar to an unwilling customer someone who feels trapped as in a dysfunctional monopoly the earlier you are the only provider in town that doesn't make you a happy customer the same is true when people are employed in an organization but have no commitment or engagement to the story so it's really useful to think of employees as customers of HR and look at it very much like a customer type relationship an ongoing customer relationship
