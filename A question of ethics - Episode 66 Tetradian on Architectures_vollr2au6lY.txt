a theme that's come up in a number of recent conversations particularly the Africa and global has been about ethics about that we really can't have a profession a fact the defining characteristic of a profession is it has a code of ethics now I seen too many incidents over too many years now of really questionable ethics in enterprise architecture for example a statement I saw in one particular post which I'll link to in the the video in the in the comments here that every single statement being made in this sales pitch on enterprise architecture was fundamentally wrong false or no not to work there's too much of our trade not just ours but others as well as too much of enterprise architecture and related fields that of selling things that just simply don't work even TOGAF the centerpiece for a lot of people Center price architecture only works in a very narrow space related to IT the moment we try to use it beyond an IT centric approach we're in trouble it doesn't work bimodal IT is another one that is well known now to not work and yet is still being sold a favorite of mine in the economics field is trickle-down economics it has been known for 40 years that it doesn't work and yet it's still being promoted as being the answer so we have a problem - with big consultancies not telling people not telling their clients that the IT centric model for enterprise architecture is fundamentally broken it broke completely once we started on cloud it's even more broken now so where are the ethics around this and also one about telling clients the truth a simple point like this I was once headhunted to join a large consultancy when we got to the second interview and one of the questions that came up was about what we would tell the clients and I said I would always tell the class the truth because otherwise they couldn't make any decision it's only became clear at that point that the interview had come to a grinding halt and in fact I never heard from them again their attitude was that we should always tell the clients what they want to hear not actually the truth so how on earth are we going to have a profession that has of those kind of problems we can't have a profession without a code of ethics now I know a number of people have been worked on this I'll include some links to some of those some of those examples and efforts in the comments in the YouTube below but do join in this conversation how can we bring ethics into as an explicit part of enterprise architecture because without it we really don't have a profession
