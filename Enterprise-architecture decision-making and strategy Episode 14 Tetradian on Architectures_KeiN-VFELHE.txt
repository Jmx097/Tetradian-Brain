okay enterprise architecture decision-making a strategy how can we use Enterprise Architecture to break out of strategy as usual but carnera I've seen is people mistaking tactics she wrote a relatively short term for strategy which is about big picture about the story but a much much more broader longer term anything from measured in years not months and significant number of years often indefinitely strategy is about how we're enacting or reaching out towards enacting the vision so in five elements for example we talked about why and who before how and what we also want to close the loop with an emphasis on performance on learning on lessons learned and benefits realized so that why provides the big picture the gives us the focus on things like the vision the thing that never should never change if we change the vision we're no longer in the same Enterprise what we call a holomap provides a big picture of the stakeholders and the relationships in this story an enterprise canvas provides us with a consistent way to map out how services work across the entire space at every possible level when we look at who we look at the importance of story the importance of the human aspects the human focus and again we look at harm at to look at look at the stakeholders and how they connect not just with the vision but with each other identify who the stakeholders are it's only then that we start to look at things like the how of it we look at change we look at innovation we look at life cycles we look at risks particularly what we called kurtosis risks or the long tail risks the ones where if we ignore them we get benefit for quite a long while but then when the will they enact when they come to reality when they eventually the risks though the the gains that we've made from ignoring the risks are actually wiped out and much more by the costs of the risking occurring so would use tools like Wardley maps which are maps to describe transitions across a space whether we're looking for where innovation takes place where commodity or services standardized services are used we look at situational awareness with those kind of tools and also show us the choices that we have so Enterprise Architecture is always about supporting the sense making when we support decision making but generally speaking we should not be the people who decide to find either strategy or the decision-making for strategy we can recommend but the choices always remain with the clients that's a big difference we need to remember
