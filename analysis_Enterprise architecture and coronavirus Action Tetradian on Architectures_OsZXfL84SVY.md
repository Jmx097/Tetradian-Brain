# Analysis: Enterprise architecture and coronavirus: Action: Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
Tom Graves recommends enterprise architecture tools from his Tetradian toolkit to prepare organizations for post-lockdown recovery amid COVID-19 uncertainty. He emphasizes mapping complexity, maintaining vision, guiding decisions, identifying allies, and continuous learning through five key tools available via his YouTube "Tools for Change" channel. These open tools help enterprises act swiftly once lockdowns ease, potentially lasting months.

## Key Takeaways
- Lockdowns may last several months, requiring immediate preparation for rapid action upon easing to avoid being caught unprepared.
- **SCAN** tool maps complexity and uncertainty, distinguishing knowns, unknowns, and actions to reduce uncertainty.
- **Visioning** provides a clear, simple anchor statement for the enterprise to maintain stability amid chaos.
- **SCORE** guides decision-making by assessing capabilities, challenges, options (opportunities and risks), responses, and real-world returns linked to effectiveness.
- **Holomap** identifies stakeholders, especially allies, crucial for support during recovery.
- **After-Action Review (AAR)** is a continuous learning process with five steps to iterate through rapid change.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Use **SCAN** to map what we know, need to know, inherent uncertainties, and real-time actions; videos available on the Tools for Change YouTube channel.
- Apply **visioning** by creating a simple enterprise anchor statement for stability in uncertainty; documented in channel videos.
- Employ **SCORE** to evaluate capabilities (strengths), challenges (resolvable to capabilities), options (opportunities + risks), responses, and returns for decision-making; multiple videos provided.
- Leverage **Holomap** for stakeholder mapping to find allies; several documentation videos on the channel.
- Conduct **After-Action Review** in five steps:
  1. What was supposed to happen?
  2. What actually happened?
  3. What was the source of the difference?
  4. What can I learn to do differently next time?
  5. What can we as a team learn and commit to doing better next time?
- All tools are free, open, and fully documented on the Tetradian Tools for Change YouTube channel for immediate use.
