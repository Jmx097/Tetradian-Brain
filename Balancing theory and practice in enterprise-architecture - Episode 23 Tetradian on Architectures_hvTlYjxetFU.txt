then the court asks how do we balance theory and practice in enterprise architecture what's the use of theory in enterprise architecture for that matter what is theory in enterprise architecture well one of the things that I'm going to emphasize is that theory in enterprise architecture is a rather different beast from what you might think of as quote scientific theory it's not about repeatability or rather we need to understand what is repeatable and what is not we can perhaps use the scan framework for this well the simple of a complicated that complicated is about Theory simple it's what we can do in real-world practice but that's all over on the side of high repeatability at the same time there are many parts of our work that are not repeatable that are what we know describe Ava's Rooker volatile uncertain complex and ambiguous these are real parts of the work and we need to get us to have a theory that straddles comfortably across that space what we think of as a team problem is one that when we solve it it stays solved but there are many parts of our work that are also or Michael wilds problems where if we want to repeat them they're not the same that as we do them as we go through or if we put them into different conditions the result comes out differently if we put it into a different context it's different this is one of the problems that we have with best practice for example best practice is the best thing that worked for someone else in their context but it doesn't necessarily work the same way with us we need to understand the difference and be very clear what is repeatable and what is not that when we work with with wicked but with world problems we're looking for the factors that say the same rather than the content that stays the same don't mix them up it doesn't work likewise things like in uniqueness if our company has something special unique its secret sauce then that's not going to copy well in fact we don't want it to copy well into someone else's environment it's our niche if we copy it across and publish all of that we've lost our market we've lost our niche we've lost the uniqueness of our business model so there are parts of our work then they're not so much like science but are actually more like alchemy when we're working with the uniqueness rather than the sameness and then Enterprise a theory of enterprise architecture needs to cover all of that space not just the easy repeatable bits what we need particularly is what's known as pragma or theory informs practice but practice interning for really informs theory so what we need is just enough theory to support the practice that's where Theory fits is very similar to how we worked with just enough certainty just enough process just enough method here it's just enough theory to support the practice that we need
