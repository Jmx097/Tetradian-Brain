so Annika Annika clever we're at the intersection conference the design the enterprise design conference in Lisbon and the Academy to CNCs what I wanted to ask you was about the Milkyway framework that you and your colleague developed and where it fits in this spectrum between enterprise design enterprise architecture what is supposed to do what its purpose yeah maybe the backbone of the Milky Way's actually try to get the way of sense making and making people understand this super abstract and complex area of architecture so I tried to do it for seven years and then I realized I'm not coming through with a more traditional models and so on so I try to find analogy from map making actual geography matters so that's of where it started and put the Amos to make sure that we know what we know and if we agree on what is it that we have here our company our network or whatever we're trying to design on and once you have that stable ground on the shared knowledge then you can do this assigned opponent instead of trying to figure out what you're designing who's designing and how we actually react since we have sense-making in making the shared mental model into an actual map yeah reminds me a lot of both the work we've been doing on change mapping but also the work that common ground did on parish Maps building a sense of place but in this case this is a place within the enterprise and for the enterprise enterprise fits within the story exactly yeah and also I guess a you really started with the internal part of the under personally focusing on the value flow and the internal capabilities all the systems all the information everything that you would care normally about as a business architect but then we realize realize that that is a very internal point of view so we need to add customer journeys product value students and so on two nuts that you can actually have a map that is relevant for the entire scope that we're looking at which is the internal of course but also the external ecosystem and how we would combine things such as products into value streams relationships supply see see there's a huge need for the method that could sense make all this that's where we again we connect design yeah is that all these different views and different ways of working yeah but the challenge has always been to get it to be accessible and usable not by just especially trying to be but anyone who can work with the space and I think that's what you've really done with Milky Way isn't it the book was correct yeah colleague of mine sisig in London she wrote a book and it's available in English since last year so we could probably provide you a link in the description on YouTube yeah that would be really help because I've been really pushing so long for tools that help people use this material yeah in practical ways that are immediately accessible yeah but people with no need for frameworks and really it was a play a lot of the things that you've done it has been a great inspiration for me like like the one that told you about the enterprises a story we need to get out of the books as out of the great things into where it actually comes to life and also the idea of the service definitions and so on and how that could work so there there is a lot of inspiration for you or what yeah that's really great thank you very much Annika thank you for I know you've been but that's great thank you very much thank you for having me
