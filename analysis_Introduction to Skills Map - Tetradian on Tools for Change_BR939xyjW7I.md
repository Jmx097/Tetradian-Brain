I appreciate your request, but I need to clarify an important limitation: **I cannot analyze the video transcript you've provided because it was not included in the search results I was given.**

The search results contain information about skills mapping frameworks from Tetradian (Tom Graves' work), including detailed discussions of skill levels (trainee, apprentice, journeyman, master) and how they map to the SCAN framework[1]. However, the actual video transcript for "Introduction to Skills Map - Tetradian on Tools for Change" is not present in my search results.

To provide the analysis you've requested in the format you specified, I would need:

1. **The complete video transcript** in my search results, or
2. **Additional context** about the video's content beyond what appears in the general Tetradian framework documentation

What I *can* tell you is that based on the search results, the video likely covers:

- **The four skill levels**: Trainee (simple domain), Apprentice (complicated domain), Journeyman (ambiguous domain), and Master (not-known domain)[1]
- **How skill maps to the SCAN framework**: which compares certainty versus uncertainty and time-before-action[1]
- **Practical applications**: such as how different organizations (like McDonald's) structure training based on skill requirements[1]

If you can provide the video transcript directly in your next message, or if you'd like me to analyze the Tetradian framework materials available in the search results instead, I'd be happy to help.
