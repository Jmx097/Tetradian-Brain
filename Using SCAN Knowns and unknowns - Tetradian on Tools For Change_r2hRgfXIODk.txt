once again we're looking at the scan frame about this very simple framework that helps us make sense of complexity we've got a time axis from an arbitrary now looking before how long before that now happens and also after and the other axis going from certainty to uncertainty predictability to unpredictability known to unknown and there's a really useful way of looking at that whole issue of knowns and unknowns about known owns unknown knowns and so on that we can use scan to help us make sense of what's going on so in one direction we have the split in scan between the split between time to think versus no time to think and in the other direction from certain the boundary of effective certainty as we've said before this is like the old Einstein phrase that on the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results that's true on this side when the world is certain but on as we cross over this boundary the boundary of effective certainty the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting the same results so we have this shift between the known and the unknown so so I'll mark that as boundary of effective certainty it may be uncertain on this side somewhat uncertain but we know we can get the same results here we don't so this distinction between the known and the unknown there's unknowability about it and in effect down the point of action we're dealing we have to be dealing with known knowns we know that they're known and we will use a machine this is where automation comes into its into its Forte comes into its own when we're dealing with known unknowns things that we know are unknown that's Wes human skill comes into the picture a machine can't cope with the kind of uncertainties that get as we get further and further across this line when we're dealing with unknown unknowns in the unknown unknowns we will start to identify sorry unknown knowns we can make something known and what we do is we as they become more known we bring them over that's what experiment are supposed to theory hypothesis theory converts an unknown known into something that is known but at runtime we can hit up against unknown unknowns that's where they arise most often or we will either try to force them up into the known we're forced to go back to try to think about them or else if we have to do them and deal with them in real time they force us into the unknown which again as they become remem if they remain unknown unknowns will also force us here which is again backwards from whit forces is to spend time going back and creating time to think now there's a trap here that comes straight out of classic Taylorism or so-called scientific management it assumes that everything terrorism assumes that everything is reducible to known knowns when it hits up against an unknown unknown it has to go up or it can force itself over to there but always it pushes us away from the front line away from dealing with unknowns in real-time the only way we deal with an realtor in real time is through skill which is the one thing that Taylorism tries to remove it's trying to automate everything but automation can't deal with either on any kind of unknown at all the other thing that happens which is a major problem this is this is why it's called the edge of panic which you've seen from another video there is fear that sets in we get denial pushing back we get escalation up to the manager who doesn't know how to deal with it or the expert who doesn't know how to deal with it in real time so Taylorism has got a lot of traps that we need to resolve because it causes slowdown or breakdown every time it hits up against it unknown so scan is really useful for helping us make sense of these patterns like known unknowns and so on about how we move and how they move around within the certainty versus time space it's a very useful tool for this kind of purpose thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
