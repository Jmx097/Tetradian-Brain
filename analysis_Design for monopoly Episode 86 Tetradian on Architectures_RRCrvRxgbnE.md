# Analysis: Design for monopoly: Episode 86, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video explains that designing for monopolies, such as government or essential public services, requires serving the entire enterprise without exclusion, unlike competitive markets where selective dominance is possible. Abandoning any part of the market, as seen in banks or public transport withdrawing from small communities, breaks the overarching story and leads to failure. Monopolies demand universal service to citizens rather than cherry-picking customers, imposing unique responsibilities that shift issues from commercial to political when breached.

## Key Takeaways
- Monopolies like government succeed only by adequately serving **all players** in their market space, with no option to exclude anyone.
- Commercial entities acting as monopolies (e.g., banks abandoning small communities or public transport dropping unprofitable routes) risk failing the entire enterprise story.
- In monopolies, stakeholders are **citizens of the story**, not customers, requiring inclusive service over profit-driven selection.
- Cherry-picking in monopolies creates **inefficiency** and **trust issues**, rapidly politicizing operations and preventing privatized profit-socialized risk models.
- Designing for monopoly means taking responsibility for the **whole story**, fundamentally differing from designing for a competitive niche.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- When architecting for monopolistic enterprises (e.g., government, public services), prioritize designs that ensure **universal coverage** across all market segments, even if commercially unviable.
- Avoid assigning monopoly-like services to purely commercial organizations without safeguards, as they may withdraw from low-profit areas, breaking the enterprise.
- Shift mindset from "customers" to "citizens" in monopoly contexts to enforce inclusive service and mitigate political risks from exclusions.

## Quotes
- "That kind of market space that kind of story only succeeds when all of the players in that space are adequately served."
- "Dominance of a market where you can pick and choose is not the same as a monopoly because if someone's left out the story fails."
- "We in fact don't have customers we have citizens they are citizens of the story that we are claiming to serve all of."
- "If we betrayed some players it shifts rapidly from commercial to political and we can't play the games of privatized profit socialites risk."
- "Designing for a monopoly is different from designing for playing only one part of a story within an enterprise in a monopoly we're actually taking over the whole of the story."
