# Analysis: Enterprise architecture in miniature - 2: First steps - Episode 81, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
This episode outlines the initial steps in applying enterprise-architecture principles to a one-person organization's project of building a mobile learning-lab van for teaching and demonstrating whole-enterprise architecture. It emphasizes an iterative design process using a notebook for capturing ideas, a context-scope-plan-action-review cycle, and balancing interconnected scopes, values, and constraints in a constrained space. Success is defined by personal satisfaction and holistic functionality across work, rest, and mobility.[4][6]

## Key Takeaways
- Enterprise-architecture principles apply universally, even to a single-person enterprise like a #VanLife mobile lab for architecture teaching and demonstration.[4][6]
- Use an **iterative design process** to capture numerous ideas from unexpected sources, building toward a viable business model around travel and teaching.[1][4]
- Employ a **context-scope-plan-action-review** cycle: identify context, focus on a scope, plan briefly, act, review (generating new ideas), guided by the enterprise's story, values, and success criteria.[6]
- Success means **personal satisfaction**—enjoying the work—and ensuring all interdependent scopes (e.g., power, heat, light, water, storage, hygiene) function cohesively in limited space.[4]
- Address **value themes** like privacy, security, financial viability, reliability, adaptation, reuse, and self-demonstration of design principles.[4][6]
- Every decision involves **trade-offs** due to complex, interweaving constraints—e.g., expanding one scope reduces space in another.[4]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Capture ideas iteratively**: Maintain a notebook to record all insights, no matter how small or unexpected, as part of building toward a viable work idea and business model.[4][6]
- **Apply the CSPAR cycle** (context-scope-plan-action-review):
  1. Start from the enterprise **story** for values and success criteria (e.g., satisfaction, enjoyment).
  2. Identify **context** and select a **scope** (e.g., power, airflow, communications, work/rest/play/move).
  3. Create a **brief plan** for the scope.
  4. **Act** on it (e.g., design or prototype).
  5. **Review** outcomes, which generates new ideas to loop back.[4][6]
- Design with **interdependent scopes** in mind: List functions like power, heat, light, airflow, water, communications, access, storage; ensure they interact without conflict in tight constraints.[4]
- Evaluate **trade-offs**: For every choice in one scope (e.g., more storage), assess impacts on others (e.g., reduced movement space); aim for financial viability, hygiene, reliability, and adaptability.[4][6]
- Use the enterprise as a **live demonstrator**: Build so the van reflects and showcases the architecture principles in use.[4]

## Quotes
- "things are going to change we know they're going to change so there are lots and lots and lots of little ideas some of them coming up as insights from unexpected directions all of them we want to capture working iteratively towards a viable work idea"[4]
- "this whole idea of context scope plan action or review we identify something within the within the overall scope or the overall context work on a piece of scope setting an area to work on do a brief plan about idea about what we're going to look at do the looking at it do a review which itself produces new ideas"[4]
- "success is when people are satisfied when I'm satisfied that I'm enjoying the work that I do everything affects also offense everything else"[4]
- "every choice every everything involves a trade-off when we're looking at a scope of function another scope is affected another scope is affected try to push more space there loses space here when everything's tightly controlled by constraints"[4][6]
