several people have asked me well what is the enterprise when we talk about enterprise architecture what is the enterprise the usual answer people will give is an enterprise's a big organization a commercial organization but a much more useful definition is a much older one from Adam Smith well he talks about enterprises the animal spirits of the entrepreneur we're not saying this is the true definition but it's simply one that's much more useful because the enterprise is a story where the best way to understand it is it's like a story if the enterprise is only the big organization then it's the story consists of the organization talking to itself so enterprises the organization and the people inside the organization but then there's the organization in terms of its supply chain its state's suppliers its customers its suppliers suppliers its customers customers there is a shared story that connects all of these together then the enterprise includes things like the market space so it includes people like the regulator's the journalists who say what the enterprise is the shared enterprise is there's the recruiters who provide people who know how to work within this enterprise there are the the people who drive the market itself there's all your competitors there are all of these people who are in a shared story as shared enterprise and then beyond that there's another much broader group of stakeholders the countries that we live in the communities that we operate through the families of our employees of our customers of our suppliers there are what we call anti clients people who really object to the way in which we operate within that story so if we think of enterprise as a story it connects everyone within that space and we position ourselves within that story that's providing certain services that support the way that that story works so whilst the usual definition of the enterprise as our big company is common it's actually not that useful it's much more useful to think in terms of an enterprise as a ship as a layered shared story the story of ourselves of how we relate to our customers and suppliers how we relate to others in the market space and how we relate to people in a broader sense that's a more useful description of enterprise that's the one on which we base all of our work in enterprise architecture beyond
