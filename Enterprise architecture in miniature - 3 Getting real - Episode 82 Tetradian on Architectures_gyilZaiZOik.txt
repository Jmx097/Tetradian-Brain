continuing off with this idea of enterprise architecture in miniature the idea of architecture for a one-person organization and the idea of using as an example a digital nomad van life idea if you like so we've so far looked at the big picture and the first steps what we're looking at now is the move from in terms of five elements moving from context towards practical scopes so to do that some of the scopes I found when I was looking at this were looking at best practices looking at what the business models might be what the operating model models might be what kind of things I need to develop to make it work and what at each stage of that might be the minimum useable product or service so that it can pay its way as it goes along so for best practices I looked up some of the examples that were around for digital nomads and they talked about the need for a business model well that's one thing I've got that's the whole idea here describe document and promote what you're doing through things like YouTube which again is a cool idea of what I'm doing here I need to have financial reserves for problem issues and so on which again that's where investment comes in that's part of the plan I need to do live prototypes which is something I haven't done yet and I need to move towards that's what the major driver is right now and then look at the equipment that I need to make it work on the one side the tools that I have but on the other things like cameras and so on and I need to learn how the utilities work water light power access all of those kind of things and also learn how to maintain everything including the vehicle itself on the road so the first one of these was about business model what would be a viable business model well actually there's a lot to it I might start from business model canvas and immediately I can see there are multiple parts to the business model there are think teaching for example we've said teaching as part of it documenting himself promoting itself becomes an income the idea of engaging people in the work brings its own value which may not be money but it's still part of the business model so we're moving from business canvas slowly towards enterprise canvas looking at the services so here's one example would be a part of a business model it might be that we built a business model around you come in with an idea and go out with an initial plan for action now the tools that I would use from that from the existing tool set that I had would be something like score to look at strategy and the strategic options and choices and what we do about them abuse the tool called the holomap which is understanding an idea of context and stakeholders in that context what kind of looking at the services for which I would use enterprise canvases at all and the service cycle about connections between services and what's needed to make that all work now we could cover that in an hour to two hours there's a real business model about really practical ways of building of helping people understand what their choices are effectively using enterprise architecture to support to the enterprise architecture of small organizations I need to look at the viable operating model how the actual operations of all of this would work about for example for that I look a lot at enterprise canvas and look at how the support services work about how different things different themes value themes thread through every part of the process I need to look at development tasks on the one side making sure that my tool sets available all the thinking tools like score scan and so on on the other I need to look very much at the ville van built sequence because again I need to look at what the minimum useable product are services at each stage of the van build in order to be able to move around and be a digital nomad to teach around the place so I need to look at what is the sequence of the build and then what is the minimum that I could do in relation to the business models I just looked at at each stage of that bill that's what we still do to start getting real about the enterprise architecture for a single person organization and putting it into practice
