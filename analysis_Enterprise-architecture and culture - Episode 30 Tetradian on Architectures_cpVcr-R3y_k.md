# Analysis: Enterprise-architecture and culture - Episode 30, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video examines how cultural contexts—ranging from national scale (small vs. big countries) to societal and religious influences (Islamic, Indian, East Asian)—shape enterprise architecture practices, challenging the dominance of Western "big country" frameworks built on specialization and documentation. It argues that agile, relationship-focused approaches from smaller or non-Western cultures offer valuable lessons for rapidly changing environments, urging architects to view culture as a critical lens for adapting EA.

## Key Takeaways
- **Small country vs. big country attitudes**: Big countries rely on large teams, specialists, and documents for EA, while small countries (e.g., Australia, Netherlands) foster generalist "everyone thinks like an architect" approaches due to limited talent pools, better suiting agile needs.
- **Cultural mismatches in frameworks**: Most EA frameworks assume mechanistic, Western structures, but fail in contexts like Eastern societies where religion (e.g., prayer in Islamic cultures) deeply influences work.
- **Islamic culture influences**: EA might emphasize zakat (charity/responsibility), ban usury, prioritize tribal relationships over technocracy, and enforce strong gender separations affecting group dynamics.
- **Indian culture elements**: Concepts like jugaad (frugal innovation with available resources), and assigning tasks to deities (e.g., Ganesh, Shiva) could reframe EA around practicality over high-tech solutions.
- **East Asian cultural challenges**: Seniority hierarchies, fear of "loss of face," and leaders expected to have all answers hinder risk-taking and agility in fast-changing settings.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Adopt **small-country practices** for agility: Encourage generalist thinking where "everyone's done a bit of everything" and rigid specialist silos are minimized, reducing reliance on extensive documentation.
- Use **culture as a lens** for EA adaptation: Analyze enterprise boundaries, responsibilities, and interactions through local cultural norms (e.g., tribal focus in Islamic contexts or jugaad in Indian settings) rather than imposing mechanistic Western models.
- In diverse or global teams, assess cultural impacts like gender separations, religious duties (zakat), or hierarchy to redesign team structures and processes for better fit.

## Quotes
- "In the smaller countries... there's a small technical pool... everyone's done a bit of everything, everyone is thinking like an architect before they start."
- "A structure which assumes that everything is mechanistic... actually doesn't work very well [in the East]."
- "In Islamic culture there's much stronger separation between the genders so much so that people don't really like having the idea of different groups mixing together."
- "Jugaad—the idea of making do with what we have rather than always looking for the next most technical solution."
- "In [East Asian] culture... the leader by definition is the person who has the answers which doesn't work well... in a rapid changing environment where no one actually has the answer beforehand."
