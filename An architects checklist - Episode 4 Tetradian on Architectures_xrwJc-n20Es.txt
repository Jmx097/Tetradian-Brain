hi welcome back to two trade union architectures this one's about what we call the architects mantra about dealing with uncertainty the fundamental of our work is always about uncertainty so there are three phrases that we'll find ourselves using a lot and we need to know how to work with them three phrases are I don't know it depends and just enough detail so with I don't know the first one is we have to be willing to say I don't know nothing that's hard for someone at an executive level because was expected to be the people with the answers but as we said in a previous session the fundamental of our work is not so much finding the answers because those come up all other on their own if we first get the right question and the first requirement for looking for a right question is I don't know and in responding to I don't know we need to know how to find out or know know who will find out so what we say I don't know we need to be able to respond by saying I know how to find out the second one it depends probably the most hated phrase from an architect but also necessarily the most common and the point here is that if things are going to work better together and on purpose we need to know what everything depends on what the relationships are the interdependencies the togetherness that is needed again when we say it depends we need to be able to say and I know how to find out what it depends on the third one just enough is always tricky there's no easy answer to this one just enough detail just enough architecture just enough time the trick here is to avoid getting stuck in analysis paralysis on one side or ignoring the critical detail on the other get into balance just right and again we need to know how to find out what the right level of detail be to get the job done got a trap here because people will immediately ask well what do you mean by just enough detail and the answer is I don't know it depends there's just enough detail in each so becomes somewhat recursive but there's three phrases really do matter I don't know it depends just enough detail I hope you find that useful as a mantra in your work [Music]
