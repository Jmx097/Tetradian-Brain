continuing on with this series about rethinking projects and using five elements to help rethink projects how we did project it's worth looking at the Gantt chart in terms of how five elements reframe can help us really rethink how that's going a Gantt chart a classic the classic project management tool it's made up of tasks sometimes with summary tasks each task has dependencies durations and they're in a sequence now that fits well with the exploit model where we assume things are certain but it doesn't fit well with the uncertainty of explore and yet large chunks of a Gantt chart who usually have some or small or even very large elements that explore within them so if we rethink them in terms of five elements we need tasks that focus on the test for context in other words are about purpose when the elements of each tasks the check its scope which is the people space we need to develop a plan which is preparation and the whole idea of the plan in terms of the squiggle is that we're reducing the uncertainty as we go along and it may be projects within projects tasks within tasks sub tasks within sub tasks a layered approach but it's still slowly reducing the uncertainty as much as we can when we move to action the task there is a process if you like but every task includes an element of process within it but here what we often find is that we've the stuff that we've all planned out becomes uncertainty becomes uncertain there are pieces of it that suddenly show up the bits that we'd assumed that actually akan donal could be assumed to be so the insights that arise so in a sense the squiggle actually goes backwards there we increase the uncertainty in some ways and also every task needs to be able to have a learning element in it did we achieve what we were intended to achieve what are the benefits realized to the lessons learned it's in other words performance in five elements terms and a task is not complete until we've done that after-action review so every task is now in this refrain every task looks much the same it's actually a five elements set of context or purpose scope or people plan or preparation the action itself the process and learn or performance if we rethink Gantt in terms of that every box that we see on a Gantt chart is actually this multi layered multi framed box within inside of that single box task box then it gives us a quite different way to use a Gantt chart to help us handle the explore parts of a task as well as just the exploit
