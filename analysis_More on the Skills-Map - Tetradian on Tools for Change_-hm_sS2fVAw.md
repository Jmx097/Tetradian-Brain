# Analysis: More on the Skills-Map - Tetradian on Tools for Change

## Executive Summary
The video expands on the **skills-map** tool, detailing four skill levels—trainee, apprentice, journeyman, and master—defined by distance from action and ability to handle uncertainty. It warns of risks like the **parity barrier** in learning sequences and organizational fragility from skipping intermediate skill development. Proper skills mapping ensures robust learning paths, especially for enterprise architects.

## Key Takeaways
- **Skill levels** progress from **trainee** (minimal skill, rote-following rules at the point of action), **apprentice** (low skill, learning theory and extended rules away from action), **journeyman** (mid-level skill handling patterns and mild uncertainties under supervision, away from action), to **master** (expert skill managing any uncertainty at the point of action).
- Learning sequence reverses scientific method: masters deal with **ideas**, journeymen with **hypotheses**, apprentices with **theory**, trainees with **rules/laws**, creating a **parity barrier** between ideas and fixed laws.
- **Apprentice dangers**: Just enough knowledge to get into trouble but not escape it, often leading to overconfidence (e.g., new TOGAF trainees claiming superiority over experts).
- **Journeyman-trainee clash**: Journeymen handle uncertainties trainees can't comprehend, causing confusion.
- Compressing timelines eliminates time for apprentices/journeymen, yielding brittle organizations reliant on masters that collapse under change.
- Skills-map reveals compression of learning processes, skill needs across roles, and fragility in efficiency-obsessed production cultures.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Use the **skills-map** to assess required skills for tasks, plotting levels against uncertainty and action proximity.
- Map enterprise architecture needs to ensure pathways from trainee to master, avoiding fragility—prioritize learning time over pure efficiency.
- Check for **parity barrier** in training: redesign sequences to support idea-to-law progression without "checking brains at the door" (contra Taylorism).
- For architects/business roles: Evaluate team skill distribution; if masters retire or change hits, test resilience and build intermediate development.

## Quotes
- "The learning sequence is actually the opposite of the classic science development sequence... master is the one who's dealing with ideas... trainee is working only on rules or law."
- "One of the huge dangers of the apprentice level is that it's now got just enough knowledge to understand... to get into serious trouble but nothing like enough knowledge to be able to get out of it again."
- "Personally I've often had people who've just done a weekend workshop telling me that they know far more than anyone who's done it for 20 or 30 years—this is a classic apprentice mistake."
- "When we compress time a lot we then have no time for apprentices or for journeyman... that gives us a culture... in which we only have trainees on one hand and masters on the other and no means to get from the trainees to the master level."
- "For enterprise architects... we need to be really careful to ensure that there is the means to learn the job—if that means it's gone then your business is incredibly fragile."
