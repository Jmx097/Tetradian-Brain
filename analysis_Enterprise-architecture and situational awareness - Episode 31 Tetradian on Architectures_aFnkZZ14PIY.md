# Analysis: Enterprise-architecture and situational awareness - Episode 31, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video explores how enterprise architecture supports situational awareness by integrating visible assets with invisible elements like relationships, purpose, and distributed decision-making. Drawing on German military concepts of *Auftragstaktik* and *Fingerspitzengefühl*, it emphasizes connecting frontline decisions to organizational purpose while building real-time, shared awareness across scales using tools like Wardley Maps. Technologies such as big data and IoT enhance but do not lead this human-centered architecture.

## Key Takeaways
- Enterprise architecture must connect "invisible armies"—relationships between people, sense of purpose, and information flows—beyond just physical assets and visible actions.
- *Auftragstaktik* (mission-type tactics) enables distributed decision-making at the frontline via commander's intent, guided by clear purpose to avoid emergent "POSIWID" (purpose of a system is what it does).
- *Fingerspitzengefühl* (fingertip feeling) represents situational awareness, requiring real-time information sharing across the organization rather than slow hierarchical flows to enable adaptive decisions.
- Wardley Maps build big-picture situational awareness by mapping technology evolution from experimentation to commodity, prioritizing unique capabilities on commodity foundations.
- Architecture supports awareness at multiple scales, with sensors like IoT and big data aiding but subordinate to understanding the overall picture of people, purpose, and actions.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Use **Wardley Maps** to visualize the technology landscape: track shifts from initial experimentation → bespoke → off-the-peg → commodity; build differentiating capabilities on commodity services for scalability.
- Implement **distributed decision-making**: Define clear commander's intent (desired outcome) and connect it to organizational purpose; empower frontline teams to adapt based on local circumstances.
- Foster **real-time information sharing**: Avoid rigid hierarchies; gently feed information up and down to create shared "fingertip feel" across the enterprise, supporting adaptive *Auftragstaktik*.
- Prioritize **purpose clarity** before deploying tools: Ensure decisions align with chosen purpose, not just emergent behaviors (POSIWID), to guide architecture.

## Quotes
- "We need to connect all of these invisible armies as well as the visible stuff and visible actions that we see."
- "Alf cracks tactic is about distributed decision-making that the people at the frontline need to have the information that they need our need to be able to make the decisions based on local circumstances... commander's intent rather than rigid instructions."
- "Finger spit simcha fuel which literally translates as fingertip sensitivity or fingertip feeling which is actually what we mean really by situational awareness."
- "If we don't have connection to purpose what we get... is posi wid the purpose of the system is what it does."
- "We use something like Wardley maps to build a picture of what the landscape is like and as it is dynamically changing."
