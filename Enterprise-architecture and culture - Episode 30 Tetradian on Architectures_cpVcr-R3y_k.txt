this episode was suggested mitre Academy and various others who asked about the impact of culture on enterprise architecture but I didn't just be an organizational culture but in a much larger scale the slay of the entire society the entire region a real example we came across very early on was in the difference between what we call the small country attitude versus the big country in the big countries for which most of our frameworks are built enterprise architecture is based on large teams large specialization and you use documents to connect between them but in the smaller countries by which I mean there's a small technical pool such as Australia Canada New Zealand South Africa Netherlands Sweden it's done a very different way because the technical pool is so small there is no room for ultimate specialists or there aren't anything like as many specialists everyone's done a bit of everything everyone is thinking like an architect before they start so we don't have these rigid separations instead people already know what most of the communications are so although our frameworks are built for big country approaches and big country cultures what we actually need in a highly agile rapidly changing environment is actually what the small countries already do so there's some interesting cultural aspects that come up from there talking with Tanaka dumi reminded me about an old 1950's novel by Nevil Shute called round the bend which was about a very technical environment in that case aircraft but he said that when you're working in the East have to understand that everything is about prayer the religion is a much deeper deeper engagement in the whole society and therefore everything that everyone does so a structure which assumes that everything is mechanistic an approach that is air where everything's mechanistic actually doesn't work very well so talking with Eric we looked at what it Enterprise Architecture might look like if it had started from an Islamic culture and would see things like zakat the requirement for responsibilities the role of what is it to be tax there's also the idea that you serial banking is a sin is evil you've got the localization very much around the tribe of the people and centered not on a technocracy but on the relationships within the people and there are quite different boundaries for example in Islamic culture there's much stronger separation between the genders so much so that people don't really like having the idea of different groups mixing together if we started with Enterprise Architecture from an India Indian culture we might look at what which of the gods would be related to each of the tasks that we do which of the tasks could be supported by the Ganesh which one's by Shiva or Shakti we might look much more at the the role of jugaad the the idea of making do with what we have rather than always looking for the next most technical solution well what might we learn if we'd built an enterprise architecture that started from the East Asian cultures where the culture has ever built very much around seniority that the individual doesn't have anything like the dominance well the specialist does not have anything like the dominance that it does in Western cultures there is the whole issue of loss of face which means that taking risks is actually much harder and also the idea that the leader by definition is the person who has the answers which doesn't work well wearing and wearing a rapid changing environment where when no one actually has the answer beforehand so there are lots of things that we can look at where culture becomes a really useful lens to apply to how we look at enterprise architecture itself and in turn look at how enterprise architecture connects back to the culture that worried
