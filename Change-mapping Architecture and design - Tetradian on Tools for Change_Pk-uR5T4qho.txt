to finish this brief series on introducing change mapping one of the obvious places well how do we use it when do we use it what thing do we use it for the principle is that we actually use it for everything that's particularly applies to the crucial distinctions between architecture and design we want to use it for both we want to use it for exploration we want to use it for exploitation for when we're doing something that we already know how to do because we could still learn from those as well but one of the points about the difference between architecture and design is that architecture always looks upward to the abstract how do things work together better more on purpose design goes down to the real how are we actually going to do it how do we go from the abstract down to the logical structure about how things are going to fit together in general terms then down to the physical structure of the exact software we're going to use and then down to the deployment level the one that we're going to use that operations so every single task works exactly the same way in change mapping we're always going to check context scope do the plan do the action do the review listen let's iterate round so we want to be chaining different approaches for example we do a big picture of should we even be doing this at all the next mission would be what's the basics of how we're going to do it working away from it from enterprise architects we know this is working our way down the Zachman letters going from the most abstract the biggest picture down to the fine detail of action and yet it's still exactly the same they're just different missions that draw on the previous mission were chaining from one to the next we're moving from architecture towards design another one is that word from branching with moving sideways that context may have sepals we can find a number of scopes within a context within a scope we're often going to develop a number of plans a plan many actions coming out of that plan particularly when we're trying to resolve uncertainties that we don't know to shift that unknown unknowns and unknown knowns into known knowns or at least knowable was but we're also doing a lot of nesting the chief mapping structure itself the court context plans a good context spoke plan action review that's rather abstract and it's generically gonna be the same everywhere but we also need to call in context specific things if we're working in finance we're going to be using very different tools but then if we're working in IT or if we're working in HR if we're working in marketing they depend on different models and different tools we'll use in different industries at all we might use or a framework we might use in banking is not the same as with one used in telecoms or in farming so those are context specific tools but they act as plugins we call in those to go down into the detail it's like nesting boxes so there are little mini missions what we don't know something we can fire off a mini mission to say that we now need to find out about this our mission within this larger mission is to find out about something so the same principles that still apply it also helps us to keep on track to purpose and to prevent scope creep so we're using this consistently every scope every scale we're changing from one task to another from one learning level to another from chaining down from from the most big picture down to the operations the results are looping back they're still always following the same change mapping approach we're branching when we're running branches in parallel we're linking them together that's necessary and we nest down to fight the detail that we need so all of this provides a consistent frame for tackling the whole issue from going from architecture through to design through to operations and bareback so when people talk about DevOps for example we're talking about arc DevOps Resort slaughter over the multiple time scales it's still exactly the same approach that's what helps us keep our sanity when the complexity rises beyond the normal levels of that we can bear so change mapping is completely consistent whether we're doing architecture design or whatever it's the detail tools that we call in the change but we're Handel Magnus a consistent way as well the core methods hold them all together is always the same every scope every scale every type of context every type of content every third stage of implementation every time scale that's what we can do in the chain above it thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
