in this set of videos we're talking about a tool called the holomap which helps us map out the stakeholders in a context what our relationships are with them and how we work to connect them all together how we use that relationship in the previous video we looked at the content of an enterprise in this case the enterprise is ideas worth spreading that's the tagline for the Ted videos the TED conferences and we look to the different things about one of the things that make up that enterprise what are the things the actions the locations are the people the events and the decisions we now want to start mapping it out in terms of who are the stakeholders who are the players in this overall enterprise so we've started with this idea of the ideas worth spreading we've got we now start to look more who the people are what what they play what roles they each play because if we want to position our organization into this enterprise by definition we will be in relationship with everyone who's in this enterprise so the first ones we might think of are people with ideas there's the conference venue the organizers the people who do that there are the people who people who find find people with ideas there are people who promote there are people or machines or whatever that sell tickets there are people who print from print promotion print or present promotion there's all the customer service there's social media both before and after the event and during the event too that's what we might call follow up so publishers and we might have several of those because we might have booked video we start looking wider and we start saying how do we get people to the venue so these are travel and so on we build up a picture of who all these are now if we want to position ourselves in this organization let's say we want to be a social media provider we want as a social media provider which is our business we want to connect into this enterprise of ideas worth spreading what roles do we have what what positioning do we have we're mapping out who all these people are including one group which a lot of people forget which we might call anti clients who are people who object to for example new ideas there's also governance what rules and regulators so regulators we've got to deal with so all of these by definition we have some relationship with but for example our relationship with the people with ideas themselves there are more distant relationship where as customer service we might have a very strong relationship with it might be part of our role to track or or identify anti clients through social media so we are supporting different people with different relationships our relationship with the conference venue is going through whoever's doing the actual organizing of the conference we don't necessarily have any relation direct relationship with the conference venues we don't particularly find them and so on so we start connecting with different players we start building an understanding of who the people who the players are in the overall story this gives us an idea of the big picture of the enterprise that we choose to be in thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
