a question that comes up quite often is when does enterprise architecture fit within the organization who did it report to who should it be funded by well the short answer here is it depends yes that answer again it depends if you're doing classic IT centric Enterprise Architecture where it's really only about IT and the enterprise means its enterprise scale rather than enterprise scope then you're usually going to be stuck under the CIO and that's fair enough if that's all you're doing but it means you don't have the authority to challenge anything further out if you're a solution architect or solution architects they usually funded by part of the PMO usually funded in turn by the whoever the project owner is but the PMO the project management office is usually where you'll find solution architects domain architects application architects infrastructure architects IT hardware IT architects security architects then usually associated with a particular domain that may be under the PMO and may be wider if it would necessarily be so for security architecture which expands quite necessarily expands quite a long way beyond IT but as the scope expands so we move towards a true architecture of the enterprise but then we need a broader Authority I've been in an organization where we didn't have that where we were under the CIO and we hit up against a problem that was actually with the way that the organization's accounts were structured and the suddenly there was nothing we could do because we didn't have the authority to charge it as a result there are hundreds of millions of dollars being wasted every year in that organization because they couldn't shut anything any old unwanted project down every project closed down an old system an unwanted system ended up with a negative business case so in Australia post we framed it such that we reported to the entire executive and we had the authority to go anywhere and everywhere in the organization at any level because really that's where the architecture fits by definition the architecture offense and is affected by everything everywhere if we don't have the authority to go there we actually can't do our jobs
