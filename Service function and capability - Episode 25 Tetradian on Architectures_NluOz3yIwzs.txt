this one's for Eric Weinstein who asks for more details about the distinctions between service function and capability the way I describe it is that what we want is a definition of service that works at any scope any scale any level anywhere any type of content it needs to be completely consistent that means it's going to differ slightly from the way that other people use it but at least we know it's going to be the same everywhere so the service elements the things that make up a service we define as asset function capability which itself is made up of agents assets and skills the location events and decisions that relate to that service so on the surface a service and a function look much the same because the function is the interface to that service and the service level agreement template it's a black box if you like it's a black box view of the service so it's template that specifies the SLA part is a template that specifies what needs to be in the SLA but not the detail they can't do it's just a template a capability is the ability to do something the thing that makes up does that does the actual work of the service and itself is often made up of services and assets so it's a white box for you we look inside the service to see what's the actual service is made up of so the service packs together all of these elements together with a specific service level definition based on the capabilities that it has behind it so for example if we're sorting the mail the capability the service can be delivered by any combination of people machines and some types of IT but the level that we can deliver at varies according to what the capabilities behind that service so it packs together all of these different elements the function the capability and so on so process which is another term that people look for is the sequence of services chained together they may be chained together in a predefined sequence they may be defined in a kind of ad hoc way but a process is just a chaining together of services to a common kind of purpose and in a sense a process is also a kind of service an encapsulation of service so the boundary of what is a service is what we say it is and that's one of the complications there isn't a predefined definition of what services it's what we say it is so the service elements are asset function capability location event and decision a function is the interface and a kind of black box view of the service so the outside it looks much the same as the service itself the capability is what the service can do underneath it's inside the box of the service the service packs together all of the elements and a process is a way in which we link it together services to a common need or a comedy
