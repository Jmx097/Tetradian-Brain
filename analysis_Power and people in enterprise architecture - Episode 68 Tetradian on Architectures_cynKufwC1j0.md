# Analysis: Power and people in enterprise architecture - Episode 68, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
Power in enterprise architecture is defined as the ability to do work, which can be measured across forms like power-over, power-under, and dysfunctional competition, and mapped to dimensions of effectiveness such as efficient, reliable, and human-oriented. The speaker emphasizes indirect intervention tactics for power issues, especially avoiding direct confrontation in major conflicts, and highlights enterprise architecture as a politically challenging yet highly rewarding domain.[1][4][6]

## Key Takeaways
- Power is measurable on a scale (e.g., increasing or decreasing) and categorizable into forms like power-over, power-under, power-lost, incompetent, dysfunctional, and competition.[1][4]
- Map power dynamics to effectiveness dimensions: efficient, reliable, elegant, human-oriented, integrated, and on-purpose/appropriate, applicable to both technology systems and human relationships.[1][2]
- Systems enabling timely, trustworthy information enhance work ability, while unreliable ones destroy it, illustrating power's impact on productivity.[1]
- Use indirect tactics from resources like the book *Semper et Score* to address power problems without direct confrontation, which worsens major fights.[1]
- Enterprise architecture is inherently political and power-focused but offers the most rewarding work in technical and human senses.[1][3][6]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Measure power**: Assess power forms (e.g., power-over where people prop up by putting others down) on a scale and track changes over time.[1][4]
- **Map to effectiveness**: Align power issues with dimensions like efficiency or reliability; for example, compare systems by whether they provide "all the information I need exactly when I need it" versus untrustworthy outputs.[1][2]
- **Intervention tactics**: Refer to *Semper et Score* (free sample available) for specific tactics per power problem; avoid direct tackling of major power-over conflicts—instead, pick a related theme (e.g., efficiency) to trickle improvements into the issue.[1]
- **Indirect approach for fights**: When facing propped-up power dynamics, work on adjacent areas like reliability to indirectly resolve problems without escalation.[1][6]

## Quotes
- "Power is the ability to do work and if it's the ability to do work then surely we should be able to measure it."[1]
- "We can usefully look at power with power over power under power lost incompetent dysfunctional competition those are all forms that we can actually measure."[1][4]
- "Do not try to tackle it directly all you will do is make it worse what we have to do is to pick a theme that is in the same strand... and work on there to kind of trickle through into the problem area."[1]
- "Enterprise Architecture is relentlessly political relentlessly about power in every sense both technical human whatever but it's probably the most rewarding work that we can do."[1][3][6]
