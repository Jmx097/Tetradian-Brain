in this episode I want to explore one of the more peculiar paradoxes that we face in particularly business architecture but enterprise architecture as well and that's the performance paradox the oddity here is that we get the best attended best result on every any axis that we think about any kind one that concerns us like financial performance we get the best results by paying attention to everything except the end result real practical example an athlete an athlete wants to renovate when I race but to do that she's got to pay attention to nutrition she's got to pay attention to clothing she's got to pay attention to body awareness how she's positioning herself she's got to pay attention to her overall training she's got to be aware of her own mindset and even in the actual race she's got a concentrate on exactly the same as if she was doing performance training because if she focuses on too much on the race she may actually fall back in performance so she gets the best result by paying attention to everything except the end intended end result another example is a motor race now the same sort of thing applies you've got all of the concerns about the driver the drivers really got to focus on the technical skills on the physical skills on the mindset on the training on the ability to handle the endurance in the ability to maintain focus over long periods of time under very stressful conditions and yet they're gonna pay result they're gonna concentrate on it as a race rather than I've got to win the race the catch with a motor race is there's all the technology and the same applies to the technology we've got to focus on all the little bits that make everything work but the technology can distract us from the fact that it's very much about people as well so most of the classic tools that we have the mainstream MBA toolkit will fail and will cause failure because it focuses on things like targets targets can be literally lethal in the infamous case of the Stafford hospital managers demanded that their financial targets had to take priority over care healthcare for individual patients the focus was on the wrong thing namely the financial targets rather than the outcome for the patient and the result was that a lot of patients died so we win the race by paying detailed attention to everything except the endpoint of that race but we also have to aware of the deeper aim at the end at all times in everything that we're doing that's the performance paradox it's a really important paradox so we need to work with throughout all of our architectures
