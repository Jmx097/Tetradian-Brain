# Analysis: Layering and interweaving in enterprise architecture: Episode 101, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary

The episode uses a town as a metaphor for a whole enterprise to demonstrate how multiple services layer and interweave across physical, temporal, and functional dimensions[3]. Rather than viewing enterprise architecture through the traditional IT-centric lens, the presentation illustrates how diverse services—from utilities to transportation to civic institutions—must interconnect, adapt, and coexist across time while managing shared resources and competing demands.

## Key Takeaways

- **Services as fundamental units**: A town (or any enterprise) comprises numerous services beyond IT, each with distinct purposes that must interact seamlessly[3]

- **Layering in multiple dimensions**: Services exist on different physical levels (below ground, above ground) and temporal layers (historical, current, future), requiring understanding of how they connect across all dimensions[3]

- **Interweaving complexity**: New services must often cut across or integrate with legacy systems (like a new road crossing a Roman-era path), necessitating careful coordination to avoid disruption[3]

- **Resource allocation challenges**: Shared resources (such as parking spaces) require architectural solutions that work equitably for all stakeholders[3]

- **Temporal persistence**: Services persist, change, and sometimes become obsolete or forgotten, yet their artifacts remain and influence current operations—an often-unexamined constraint in organizations[3]

- **Legacy and nomenclature**: Organizations often refer to things by historical names or functions rather than current reality, obscuring what architecture actually serves[3]

- **Beyond IT-centricity**: Classical enterprise architecture focuses narrowly on IT as one service among many; true whole-enterprise architecture must account for the full ecosystem[3]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials

The video presents a conceptual framework rather than step-by-step procedures. However, the practical guidance embedded includes:

1. **Map your services holistically**: Identify all services in your enterprise (not just IT), their interdependencies, and how they physically/functionally layer

2. **Audit historical references**: Examine whether your organization describes systems, roles, or structures by outdated names or purposes, then clarify current reality

3. **Assess abandoned services**: Identify legacy systems or services occupying resources without current value, and make explicit decisions about their future

4. **Plan for service intersection**: When introducing new services or processes, explicitly address how they will interweave with existing infrastructure and operations without disruption

5. **Think temporally**: Model your architecture not just as a snapshot but across time horizons, considering how services evolve, merge, or become obsolete

## Quotes

- "A town is an enterprise of enterprises... everything is a service"[3]

- "How do you allocate shared resources in a way that actually works for everyone?"[3]

- "How do you deal with when new services have to cut across an old one?"[3]

- "All of these services interweaving layering interconnecting through time and through the present time"[3]
