# Analysis: Enterprise architecture and coronavirus: Responsibility: Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video argues that individual rights are inadequate for addressing complex societal challenges like coronavirus, advocating instead for mutual social responsibilities implemented through interlocking relationships. Enterprise architects should apply business insights on responsibility failures—such as asymmetries in authority and mutuality—to guide balanced societal responses. Cultural contexts, like "me-first" Western individualism versus "we-first" Eastern collectivism, require contextual balance to avoid pitfalls like childish entitlement or groupthink.

## Key Takeaways
- Rights are personal and individual-focused, but they depend on complex, mutual social responsibilities that fail in "me-first" cultures during crises like coronavirus requiring social distancing and tracing.
- Western cultures emphasize individual rights and democracy, while Eastern and some Latin American cultures prioritize "we-first" at family or group levels, necessitating contextual balance for effective responses.
- Enterprise architects can identify responsibility failures in businesses—such as authority without accountability (leading to "superordination"), asymmetric leader-subordinate dynamics, and bonuses based on others' work—to inform societal issue resolution.
- Risks in "me-first" cultures include rewarding childish behavior and punishing responsibility; in "we-first" cultures, groupthink stifles individual input, as illustrated by a leader expecting all answers without group contributions.
- Coronavirus demands social-level responses that clash with perceived rights, making a responsibility-focused approach essential.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Examine business practices for **responsibility failures**: Look for asymmetries (e.g., subordinates responsible to leaders but not vice versa), failures in mutuality and interlocks (e.g., executives awarding themselves bonuses before bankruptcy), and incentives misaligned with collective good (e.g., managers claiming credit for others' work).
- Apply enterprise architecture experience to societal issues: Use insights from business responsibility imbalances to guide responses to complex social challenges like coronavirus.
- Balance cultural tendencies: In individual-focused contexts, promote mutual responsibilities; in group-focused contexts, encourage individual input to avoid groupthink.

## Quotes
- "Rights are actually implemented by social responsibilities mutual interlocking responsibilities and a lot of the problems arise particularly what we might call a me first culture rights are essentially personal they're about about me that I have these rights whereas responsibilities to make them happen our complex interlocks across a societal rail realm."
- "Most organizations are very me first... the most common fails we find is Authority without responsibilities it gives rise to what I call in super ordination with the opposite of insubordination where the leader itself is useless."
