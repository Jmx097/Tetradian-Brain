# Analysis: A question of confidence: Episode 96, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The speaker, an enterprise architect from Tetradian, discusses the profound challenges of maintaining confidence amid criticism from specialists and misconceptions about the architect's broad, connective role. They emphasize that architects excel at integrating elements like "mortar" between building blocks, ensuring adaptability over time, though this work often becomes invisible when successful. Distinguishing competence, non-competence, and incompetence is key to preserving self-assurance in this undervalued profession.

## Key Takeaways
- Architects face constant doubt from specialists who view their generalist approach as ignorance or charlatanism, such as being called a "charlatan" for not knowing every field deeply.
- The architect's unique value lies in understanding **how things connect** at multiple scales and over long periods, unlike specialists focused on individual "building blocks."
- Success in architecture is **invisible** when effective—like mortar holding structures together—making the role's importance hard to demonstrate until failure occurs.
- Confidence requires embracing **non-competence** (knowing what you don't know) versus incompetence (pretending knowledge), and quickly learning basics to make connections.
- The speaker's "fractal" thinking, detailed in their "change mapping book," contrasts with linear, step-by-step mainstream approaches, requiring a 10-year effort to make accessible.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Maintain confidence amid attacks**: Acknowledge emotional impact (e.g., losing a day to criticism) but reaffirm your role in connections; focus on being "clear that we are not competent in when we are" to differentiate from pretenders.
- **Learn basics quickly for integration**: As an architect, prioritize rapid foundational knowledge in new areas to link them effectively, rather than deep specialization.
- **Communicate your value with analogies**: Use the **building blocks vs. mortar** metaphor to explain how your work enables flexibility and prevents collapse when the world changes.
- **Embrace fractal thinking**: Shift from linear processes to multi-directional connections; adapt materials (like the speaker's book) for mainstream audiences who prefer step-by-step methods.

## Quotes
- "One of the hardest things to maintain as an architect is a sense of confidence I'm surrounded all the time by specialists who by definition know more about their own field than I do."
- "Our specialism is how things connect together at multiple scales and over long periods of time."
- "Where everyone else is concerned with the building blocks that make up the individual elements of a solution or an enterprise what I focus on is the mortar that holds them together."
- "Confidence is when I really know what I'm doing non competence is when I know that I don't know what I'm doing and don't pretend to incompetence is what I pretend to know what I'm doing and don't."
- "Our work is only visible when we fail our work is whenever the mortar was successful we are the less visible our work becomes."
