a conversation the other day with Miguel a beau reminded me of a recurrent problem in enterprise architecture around fixed ideas of time scale as though there's only one time scale that exists but if this often assumes that that's just for example you know the longest time scale we deal with is two years but most if you look at something like the classic ei frameworks like TOGAF they're actually designed for that kind of process that kind of approach but the reality is that we have a huge range of timescales all interweaving with each other so for example some industries I have specific timescales health for example is by definition life in fact quite often longer than life if we're looking at things like hippy epidemiology so we have to be thinking in terms of holding data on someone health information for a hundred years or more whereas most of the devices the little sort of Fitbit and so on know things about what's going to happen when those devices die because there's no way of getting the information back out of there and putting it into somewhere more useful but health is in a hundred years sounds ridiculously long too many business people but that's actually what we're dealing with and yet when we look at something like civil engineering those timescales can go back hundreds of years I think I mentioned in a previous video that parts of the london sewerage system are actually Rumer they're 2,000 years old these are practical issues that we need to consider if we're working in those domains IT looks a very short term by comparison we also got some context specific challenges for example in telecoms we have very real challenges around the speed of light when we're looking at information going out back to or to a satellite or for that matter when we're dealing with them incredibly small distances involved in in the internal workings of a computer Admiral grace hopper the inventor of COBOL you still walk around with sticks that were about that long the strings are wire because that's the distance that light travels in a nanosecond when you're dealing with time scales that small these become very real issues another one in terms of my own business my own range the shortest time scale I would routinely deal with this probably stopped microsecond but the longest time scale I've had to deal with as an actual business issue was a quarter of a million years because we were labeled enabling hazardous goods or looking at issues around labeling of hazardous Goods and in the case of nuclear waste we're talking about that kind of time scale literally ten times longer than recorded human history when we have to put up a sign that says don't touch and we genuinely mean don't touch that what we're dealing with forever chemicals in principle by according to the legislation we have to label it forever that's an interesting challenge fairly obviously we marked it as non-compliant but non-compliant doesn't mean that it disappears it means that we have to come back and look at it again and again and again until we can finally way to make it work so these are real timescales that occur in real business environments as I said mine range from sub microsecond to a quarter of a million years other people may well have longer in each duration the other one which came up particularly in that conversation is the fractality of timescales we tend to think of strategy tactics operations in a very fixed way that strategy is sort of the big picture has a longer time scale and tactics gets smaller and then weed operations is very much focused around that now but a useful way of looking at that in terms of scan certainly and that's a useful way to frame it is in terms of that strategy is kind of above the plan stage strategy is the big picture where does it fit in relation to the two whole dynamically changing over time the plan phase is the before we do action that's where tactics tends to sit and operations is in the during phase but notice that this can have multiple there was this pattern will stay the same across multiple time scales so that someone's someone else's strategy could be our operations if we're doing strategy it actually is our operations it's someone else's operations could well be our strategy so notice how these all interweave with each other the boundaries are very much ones that we choose also note that there are two fixed points here on one end there's the enterprise the vision the one the anchor that we use which should in principle always stay the same at the other end there's the transition from the now to the past once we go past that traveling now we can't change it we can learn from it but we can't change the past itself and finally notice that we choose where those boundaries are they're not fixed points they're not fix things that strategy exists certainly their tactic certainly their operations gonna be there the boundaries of where we choose them to be this is something we'll see quite often do things like services where is the boundary of a service the answer is where we choose it to be so notice these boundaries that we choose them and therefore it's important to choose wisely
