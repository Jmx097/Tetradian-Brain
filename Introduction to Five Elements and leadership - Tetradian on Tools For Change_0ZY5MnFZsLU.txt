in a previous video we looked at five elements as a model for change management as a model for describing how change actually works but we can also use it as a model for leadership when it helps to break us out of the usual idea of leaders our managers and managers or leaders because there's more to it than that we start off with a need for enterprise vision a story that holds everything together everything is in context of that story and leadership is in turn in relation to that story so the first type of leadership that we need is a leadership within the purpose domain is looking at strategies looking at context this is the team that helps us understand what purpose is but we don't stop there we need now to identify the values that trigger a shift from from moving up from purpose to actually starting to do something about it shifting towards scope we need to lead a ship that moves between purpose and scope for action then we need leadership actually in the area that's looking at scope now this is typically the portfolio management or program management and it is you'll notice a kind of manager but it's very much working in this space because the next point along is we now need a leader who's going to pick up the policies the project scope the project plan and move towards actually getting a plan happen there we beat up with another person you'd recognize the project manager the project managers job is to lead the creation of the plan and the preparation that makes sure that everything happens but with the danger here is analysis paralysis we can keep on planning and planning and planning and planning without actually getting anything started so at some point we need leadership that says we're going to start now we're going to move between we're going to move from plan into action there's a start event that says let's go within the action there's a different kind of leadership that's very much about working in the real time in the now in the immediacy that's typically the foreman for example and again we need someone to say it's time to stop otherwise we're going to loop round continually doing the same thing we need to stop and move on to doing a review now this is where the after-action review is important where we assess and make sure that we have delivered according to the success correct constraints that can success criteria that we had from the original purpose interestingly in most businesses there's no distinct role for this but it and there is a real need for the leadership to happen there and finally we need to link across the completions are what help us connect back from what we've done to the original purpose there's one more form of leadership that's always needed because each of these are often in conflict with each other so we need someone to hold of the center who holds the story is very much in relation with the story now this should be the executive unfortunately it often isn't so somewhere someone needs to be holding it all together so we have five quite distinct types of leadership within each of the domains within each of these the focus on purpose the focus on people and scope the focus on the plan the focus on action and the focus on lessons learned and completions we need leadership between each of the domains there are five quite distinct types of leadership that lead from one to another and therefore need a foot in each of the two camps and we also need another form of leadership that holds it all together keeps the balance between which of those domains so in effect what we have now is eleven quite distinct types of leadership with distinct roles we now know what leadership we need at what point in each of the projects and we hold it all together with vision with the root with the enterprise story so five distinct types of leadership five leadership's between each the domains and one hole in the center eleven distinct types of leadership thanks for watching do look at the youtube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
