for the last part of this kind of status report on enterprise architecture I want to look where we need to be probably not much more than a decade from now we've already talked about breaking out of the IOT centric box and making it much more human oriented but what we need to do that's quite a lot more that we need to do to make it really work and to find the full potential for enterprise architecture the first is that we generalize enterprise architecture as tools for change what we bring to the story is an idea that things work better when they work together on purpose we're talking about connection about purpose about alignment about getting things to dance so what we have in enterprise architecture when it's fully reworked is a kind of generic toolkit for integration for connection for relations for services across an entire context though we note that this is about decision support not decision making we support the decision makers we don't try to use up their role crucially we don't get hung up any more about the idiocy 's of the bean app framework of business data applications technology we're covering the entirety of the scope the human issues the non IT technology just as much as the IT and the way they all interweave with each other when it's shift from layers of function which is what the bean a stack is to more like layers of abstraction layers of content and seeing how they all interact and how we move from big-picture through the intentions the connections the dances through to how we're going to implement it run it learning from it continuously we also need to extend this all the way out to a global scope and scale we need a fundamental shift from the carand economics of we want it now we've got to have it now it's only about the now the current quarter to about sustainability and frankly with some of the issues we're facing just simply survival we're going to need a fundamental rethink of jobs work economics politics right their way through most of what we think of as normal does not work and there's some really important understandings that we need to get to to get our way out of the mess and make it to a survival world for all of us we're also talking about survival Arkansas survival architectures and service architectures for an enterprise where the enterprise is the whole of the planet right up to a truly literally global scale but also we need to be aware right from the start that the politics of this are huge and making connections even across a small organization is relentlessly political so we need to get some practice in on how to make that work that's the current situation that's what we need to be heading towards if enterprise architecture is to reach its full potential but the current status is we need to be reaching out to really big picture enterprise architecture all the way out to a global scope and scale
