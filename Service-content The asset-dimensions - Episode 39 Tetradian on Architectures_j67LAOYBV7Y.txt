Eric Weinstein asks about the asset dimensions which are a key theme within the enterprise's canvas model about service model about service relationships it's also extremely important in almost anything to do with process modeling and process flows assets when we talk about assets in conventional IT centric architecture we're really only talking about data and data flows but when we're talking about a whole enterprise architecture covering the whole space which in reality we need to do why are you talking about various combinations of for quite different dimensions physical virtual relational and aspirational and any object can be any kind of combination of those for example a book is physical and carries information the key distinctions are that things are alienable for example and that's only applicable to the physical dimension if I give you something a thing physical thing I no longer have it whereas I give you if I give you a piece of information I still have it it's non alienable then we've got the idea of assignable which only applies to things that are physical and virtual or fit and or virtual which is that I can give you a physical thing I can give you information but I can't give you a relationship you have to build it yourself I can't give you a sense of purpose you have to build it yourself then there are things that are concrete or abstract also concrete as opposed to abstract so for example of concrete things a relationship between two people is concrete a physical thing is concrete but data is abstract it doesn't actually exist in tangible form until it's physical likewise a sense of purpose a sense of identity is entirely intangible and then there's the difference between inch music versus between so physical things their nature is intrinsic the asset itself is a thing in its own right data is a thing in its own right but a relationship exists between two entities and to visit two tangible entities an aspirational asset or dassit dimension exists between a person and an idea a person and a memory something between a tangible thing and a non tangible thing so any asset has combinations of these as I say a book contains information so it's a physical object that contains data contains virtual information the practical implications of this and things like if you think of the standard crud rules create read update delete that we apply to all forms of data well with physical infant with physical things we have to add to that things like how are you going to store it how are you going to maintain it how are you going to track its deterioration over time these are quite different from the data itself well we don't have to worry about the storing of the storage of the data itself it's separate from the data itself we have to store data in something physical but we also think you can't transfer a relationship I can't give you a relationship that I have with someone else I can't give you my identity I can't give you my sense of purpose I can't give you the things that drive me you have to find your own well that comes very interesting is in the relationship between is the links between relational assets in the business such as when a person comes into a store and builds a relationship with this person behind the store the purpose of a brand which is an aspirational dimension asset is so that I can go into another branch of the same company and start to build a relationship much more quickly with another person because I've already got a first modicum of trust with that person I haven't got to go through the whole process all over again they're working for the same brand therefore they're in the same story so I can go much more quickly through the relationship and then through to the transactions and so on so the asset dimensions are a way of helping us understand these rather crucial distinctions about alienable versus non any level assignable versus not at not assignable concrete versus abstract and intrinsic versus between which help us understand what we can do with each of those entities and how we can relate them one to the other so the asset dimensions physical things virtual data relational links between people and aspirational links to purpose to idea to identity these are very valuable in an architecture environment
