# Analysis: Enterprise architecture and enterprise effectiveness - Episode 64, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video breaks down the tagline "things work better when they work together, on purpose" as a guiding framework for enterprise architecture and effectiveness. It systematically dissects each element—what, how, better, together, and purpose—to identify key questions and practical implications for building effective architectures. This approach serves as both an engaging catchphrase and a comprehensive checklist for enhancing enterprise-wide collaboration and value.[1]

## Key Takeaways
- **Enterprise elements ("things")** include data, objects, relationships, drivers, and brands—the "what" of the enterprise that must work better together.[1]
- **Work ("how")** encompasses different kinds of activities that need linking for effectiveness, such as processes and operations.[1]
- **Better** refers to value and quality, which are challenging to measure; architecture must connect elements to measurable improvements.[1]
- **Together** involves links, interweavings, connections, and collaboration among people and components.[1]
- **Purpose ("why")** is the shared enterprise context beyond a single organization, where multiple purposes align to drive intentional outcomes.[1]
- The tagline acts as a checklist for architecture, prompting exploration of these dimensions to boost overall enterprise effectiveness.[1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Use the tagline "things work better when they work together, on purpose" as a **conversation starter** to engage stakeholders in enterprise architecture discussions, highlighting its value in simple terms.[1]
- Apply it as a **checklist** during architecture development: for each project, ask and address—what are the things? What is work? What does better mean? How do they link together? What is the purpose?[1]
- Extend architecture beyond the organization to the **shared enterprise**, mapping how individual purposes coincide with broader contexts.[1]
