hey there back again several people have asked me what I believe about enterprise architecture or architectures in general what are my core principles the core ways that I look at things in terms of how an architecture works well the first one is a tagline I use a lot which is that things work better when they work together on purpose it's about how everything links together into a unified whole in the dynamics of change another one is that a lot of enter people in enterprise architecture come from an IT space and most of the standards are focused in there the answer is yes IT is one part of it but it's certainly not all of it in fact if we think of business in business environments IT is typically five to ten percent of the overall spend on the pub on the business then almost by definition we should be spending no more than five to ten percent of our time on IT when we're looking at the architecture of an enterprise as a whole so IT is important but it's not the center in fact everywhere and nowhere is the center that we're looking at all at the same time it's all about us also about any scope any scale any context we use the words fractal or recursive even if they sometimes worry people so it's about patterns it's about things connecting at different scales it's always complex it's always changing we're looking at things like life cycles we're looking at long tail risks for long tail opportunities what are called kurtosis risks extremely important where the gains that we we make from ignoring a risk can be wiped out and much more if if and when they were the risky eventuates we're looking also its structure not just structures but also its story but how the story of the enterprise works the enterprise itself is in essence a story and we're looking at those particulars ways of engaging all of the stakeholders the tagline are your venues there is a stakeholder is anyone who can wield pointed steak in our direction so we need to cover a much wider range of stakeholders than people often expect and the tick was the technical is important and it's where a lot of people start from the soft skills extremely important in and in an enterprise architecture scale and it becomes more political and more people oriented as the scope and the scale grow so those are some of the key assumptions that key principles that I use in all of my approaches to architecture
