most of our existing enterprise architecture frameworks focus on new bills or perhaps an update of something but what about the other end of the lifecycle if we're designing something if we're building the architecture for something surely it should cover the whole of the lifecycle from new build to decommission yeah the decommission part just isn't covered at all in most of the enterprise architecture frameworks that I've seen why not because designing for what happens at the end needs to be thought about in depth right at the beginning to make the decommissioning easier one of the traps here is that decommissioning is so easy for Delta there isn't really a decommission we just turn it off or delete the file it's gone but for almost anything else a printer a phone it's non-trivial when you get to take it all the way up to something like a nuclear submarine it's not trivial at all we need to be thinking about it right from the beginning so that we're designing for decommission we're designing for recycling we're designing for this map dismantling we're designing for reuse this needs to be part of our architecture right from the start thinking about the lifecycle as a whole what about the adaptations there's also an ethics issue here about ethics of decommission because if we can't decommissioning it we probably shouldn't build it increasingly if we can't recycle it we probably shouldn't build it and also if we can't think about how we're going to decommission something we can build up huge problems for ourselves over time a simple example is space junk when you launch up our single launcher with a thousand mini satellites in it what are you going to do when they don't they're all bits don't decay you're going to make it impossible or very dangerous to launch anything else eventually because the risks are gets to be so high so we need to be designing for decommissioning as part of the architect right from the start
