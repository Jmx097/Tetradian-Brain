one of the most important challenges that we face as we start to come out of lockdown is the real risk of what we what's called disaster capitalism a lot of people are under very real stress financially emotionally and more and that makes them very easy prey for the other kinds of parasites that we have in our culture I haven't described investors in terms of five quite different categories there's the symbiote who is committed to working with us there is the parasite who is sort of committed but how only takes it never gives there is the grazer which sounds better but in fact it's cover it's a parasite across an entire field allowing each one to recover and having no commit to any individual there's the predator and finally there's the scavenger who doesn't even bother to chase anything down but many chases everyone out of the way and there are huge problems around this because they cause enormous damage not just to individuals but to society as a whole I remember going to a cop for a gathering of property management of property issues and one of the people there one of the presenters said we love divorce he said because people are always fighting that means it's easy pickings for us it mean we make our profit from other people's pain and it is not exactly a good idea when you want to have a society that actually works when you have people running around profiting from other people's pain it also makes existing inequalities worse because the people have got lots of resources are the ones who can dive in and grab while others have to rebuild from scratch so some huge problems that we face in our roles as Enterprise architects and just as citizens as well about beware of disaster capitalism one of the huge challenges here is the whole concept of win-lose I like making seeing someone else lose because then I win a trial action approach but the trouble is that when when when lose is actually an illusory form of lose-lose the short term gain covers a longer term loss for everyone and we need to face this as a very real problem because the only way that actually wins the only choice that we have is lose lose or win win there are no other options the catch with Lu with win lose is that it's addictive because it doesn't actually work it gives a short term gain masking and a longer longer term loss so there's always the desire to do it again do it again do it again in a way that actually drives everything down in a race to the bottom we cannot survive if we continue to support this but also in a practical everyday sense we it's very hard to protect ourselves let's get against scavengers and parasites because many of the social structures we have are actually set up to support them and not us the stock market for example prioritizes the investors if the exact opposite order to what we need it puts the scavenger first but the symbiote lasts so we need to watch in ourselves as well how we tend to look for a bargain you know a great something coming up hey great I can profit from someone else's trouble we need to watch for this in ourselves we need to check everything that we do for fairness as best we can fairness to ourselves but also fans of fairness to others otherwise we will kill ourselves by supporting the parasites that set out to destroy us
