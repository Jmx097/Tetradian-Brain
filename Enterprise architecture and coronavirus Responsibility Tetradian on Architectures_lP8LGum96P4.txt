in the previous video I looked at the whole idea of rights and how they really don't make much sense when we start looking at a major social invisible complex issues such as coronavirus I want to follow on from there as a theme I talked about during there which is that rights are actually implemented by social responsibilities mutual interlocking responsibilities and a lot of the problems arise particularly what we might call a me first culture rights are essentially personal they're about about me that I have these rights whereas responsibilities to make them happen our complex interlocks across a societal rail realm to make that happen it depends also on the culture and a culture that's focused only on the individual will have considerable difficulty in dealing with something that is actually complex associate so we need to find the right balance it's very contextual in different circumstances we want to individuality you're not the circumstances we need people to line up at a fixed idea such as rights that would really doesn't work for that reason really focus instead on the responsibilities not cultural terms what we might think I was Western counters are very much focused on the individual they're about democracy is about individual rights individual focus Western cuts or Eastern cultures tend to be much more we first much more socially if you think of the relationship with the family that occurs in both Japanese and Chinese culture that you get some of the same thing in say South American cultures Latin America is very much a we first but the family level not at the whole society though so you gonna find the right balance for the context that's there and that makes it an issue for enterprise architects so that for example when we look at a me first culture what it risks falling into is what I call a a PDR key rule by for word on behalf of the most childish where we reward people for being childish and punish people for being responsible the danger way that an Eastern Time we first culture is a strong tendency towards groupthink recalling saying that he was asked to give a us a group to bless you I think it was to give an example of from their own experience of something that happened in business and he couldn't get one because in that culture the leader is supposed to be the one who has all the answers and everyone else follows so there were challenges there in both cases there's not the one is right and one is wrong it's about getting the balance right but the issue here is that particularly when we're dealing with something like coronavirus what it was something that requires a social level response about but social distancing tracking tracing all those kinds of things which clash directly with what we might think of as rights but without doing it we're in very real danger so rights often make no sense here we have to focus on the responsibilities and one place that enterprise architects and business are cadets can really look get some the practice in on this to understand what's going on is to look at how this works in most businesses now most organizations are very me first depends on the organization some have a culture that's got a strong we element but particularly in Western business it's very me first very top-down very structured very much but one the most common fails we find is Authority without responsibilities it gives rise to what I call in super ordination with the opposite of insubordination where the leader itself is useless a lot of management issues we get are because it is still very asymmetric that the leader that the subordinates are responsible to the leader but the leader is responsible to no one are certainly not responsible going that way so we need to watch for those kind of inherited balances we want to watch for fails on responsibilities fails on relationships fairs on mutuality she fails on interlocks like the example I gave in another previous video we're a company of what group of directors awarded themselves executives were boarded themselves I think it was four hundred million dollars and then declared the company bankrupt so there are some really serious issues that we need to identify what the drivers are what the supporters for the asymmetries in particular watch for things where someone's bonus sons personal rights to a bonus is actually based on other people's behaviors that often happens with a manager taking credit and little credit in the monetary sense for other people's work there are some very real issues here that we need to look at and that we can use our experience in working with business within a business looking at the responsibility fails the failures are the mutuality and interlocks we can use those to help guide us how we're going to work on a full social issues that arise
