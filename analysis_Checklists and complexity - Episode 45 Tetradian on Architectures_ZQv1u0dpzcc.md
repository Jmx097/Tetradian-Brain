# Analysis: Checklists and Complexity - Episode 45, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary

The episode explores checklists as a powerful tool for managing complexity in enterprise architecture. It distinguishes between two fundamentally different types of checklists—**prevention checklists** (used when time permits to avoid problems) and **resolution checklists** (used under high time pressure when problems are actively occurring)—each with distinct design characteristics and purposes.

## Key Takeaways

- Checklists are among the most powerful yet simple tools for managing complexity in enterprise architecture[1]
- **Prevention checklists** use sequential ordering and can be any length, designed to catch issues before they occur (e.g., pre-takeoff aircraft checks)[1]
- **Resolution checklists** are prioritized, typically 6-7 items maximum, designed for high-pressure situations where immediate action is required[1]
- The **SCAN framework** reveals fundamental differences between certain contexts (where prevention applies) and uncertain contexts (where resolution applies)[1]
- Checklists differ fundamentally from work-instructions; they assume real-world conditions won't conform to assumptions and help identify when context requires improvisation[1]
- Visual design matters: prevention checklists use portrait layouts in black; resolution checklists use different color headings and orientations to prevent confusion[1]
- In critical situations (like engine failure), checklists remind operators of essential priorities—such as maintaining correct airspeed—to prevent cascading failures[1]

## Actionable Insights

When designing checklists for your organization:

1. **Determine the context type**: Ask whether you have time available or are in crisis mode
2. **For prevention checklists**: Create sequential lists of any reasonable length; design them for careful review before action
3. **For resolution checklists**: Limit to 6-7 items maximum; prioritize by criticality; use distinct visual formatting (colors, orientation) to aid rapid scanning
4. **Focus on forgotten essentials**: Include items people naturally tend to overlook under pressure
5. **Use mnemonic devices**: Keywords like "Lights, Camera, Action" help users remember critical steps

## Quotes

"If you haven't come across this, I'd recommend reading the Checklist Manifesto because it's a really good practical introduction to what checklists look like and why they exist and how they help to reduce complexity."[1]

"When the engine packs up, it reminds people you've got to keep flying at the right speed... because if you don't you're no longer flying an aircraft, you're flying a brick."[1]
