how do we design for story in our enterprise architecture the enterprise story and for that matter what is enterprise our story mean in real practice but the first one I'd suggest is that the enterprise it's not just the company it's actually a story world a world in which we and many others appear the elements of that story are what is it that everyone is acting on or what everyone is concerned about one of the concerns or the the drivers that make it happen and what are the actions that everyone is taking a simple idea would be the Ted vision the Ted video of the Ted videos and the TED conference which is ideas worth spreading everyone is concerned about ideas the action is that everyone is spreading ideas and why is this important it's because these are ideas that are worth spreading so acted on the concern the actions and the driver the why so for a story world to work all all all players in that story world agree to and in fact must comply with the values that the descriptions of what is good and what is not good because that's where trust comes for all of the players and the story world won't work unless that's actually what's happening so our organization then positions itself positions its own story its own story line within that story world it has allies other people who help it Drive its own story competitors are the people who have exactly the same positioning in the story but allies are often people who are related but don't compete or in any real way and a light beer helps us build an interdependent mutually supportive Network a very good example is the town of hay on why in England who essentially whose entire industry is secondhand bookstores used for book meat stores for use books each of the stores supports a different part of the story so some support military history some support fashion some support cooking some support science fiction some support romance fiction they've all covering different parts of the story world but that means they're allies they are coopertition so building the whole another one would be imagine the enterprise of men - my chair if my chair breaks are now in the enterprise of mend my chair there are multiple routes into the story world of mending chairs someone may be just interested in mending chairs to themselves someone comes in because their chair is broken someone has particular services that among other things can be used for mending chairs such as a hardware store so an organization has services to help mending a chair that's how we position ourselves in the story world of mending chairs but it's not about selling into that space as Chris Potts puts it in his really useful phrase customers do not appear in our processes we appear in their experiences or as someone else put it the other day it's not the customers appear in an organization story we appear in their stories so what is it that connects together that helps the story work that drives the definitions of trust of value and so on that's where the idea of enterprises story comes in that helps us understand the story world that our organization operates within and the architecture develops out of that understanding of story of how the story flows right the way through the organization and beyond in all of its relationships in the story world that's why we talk about design for story and why we talk about enterprise a story enterprise beyond the organization
