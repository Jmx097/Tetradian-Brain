this one's a follow-on to wine stones question about the asset types the asset dimensions rather and is about the other half of the service content which is about decision types and skill levels this is really about service content and applies particularly in the capability part of the service content content and also the decision reason the why part of the service content there are some parallels to asset types and they're not exactly the same and they work in a slightly different way so the way we label the decision types the skill levels is trainee apprentice journeyman and master these are the four classic levels and they relate quite well to the domains out of scan which are that a trainee is really only capable of doing something simple that is step by step that is controlled is defined a journeyman can handle things that are more calculated more complicated but they still have to be about control you can't really let an apprentice loose on something that's uncertain a journeyman is able to deal with certain levels of uncertainty as long as they've got supervision and a master has to be able to deal with anything that the real world throws at us now a really important warning here is that most of the software area is only capable of dealing with things and either training level or at best but apprentice level they're not well suited to dealing with deep uncertainty or any kind of uncertainty in many cases there's if you've got predefined decisions then you're still at only the apprentice level so that when we talk about artificial intelligence or machine learning most of it is still only at this level we would not shouldn't would not and should not let it loose at a real-world uncertainty we've seen that problems start to arise with driverless cars and with autonomous vehicles or all talent particularly when we start heading into autonomous military systems these are not a good idea because they don't have the backup all the legal issues around responsibility that can help us track them so we can use tools such as scan simple complicated ambiguous not known to map what the requirements are and we also use scan to help us track what's happening at run time so at runtime there is no time to stop and think so to some extend the apprentice of the journeyman are both cut out we've only got really the choice between the trainee and the master and a lot of organizations try to run that way and wonder why they suddenly run into very deep trouble because as we heat up against the edge of panic that transition between the simple and the other not known between the the trainee and the master as we heat up against that we need quite different types of skills and skill level to deal with what the real world has thrown us so we need to map out what these are understand what the skills are because in a classic terrorist environment what you do is you push it away from the real time and that slows everything down you push it away to think about it and come back down again so we need to map out what the skills are the decision types are and how to how they're going to be operated and then also how you're going to implement them in real-world practice because software cannot do everything that's a really really dangerous delusion so the decision level the types and skill levels are part of the service content we need to understand what they are and how to use them in order to make the services work
