everyone I'm going to welcome back to my channel you know one of the most popular questions that I always get is how do I stay organized and how do I keep all of my leads and everyone that I speak to organized in like a database now there are many resources out there there are many crms but in this video i'm going to be covering one resource that i recently started using and I have completely fell in love with and that is Trello prior to me starting to use Trello which I started consistently since December I had looked into it about a year ago but when I first looked into it it just seems so complicated and I feel that over the Christmas and winter break something just kind of clicked and I learned how to use it pretty much in like a day now Trello is a platform it's completely free it's online and the best thing is that it also comes in the form of a mobile app so you can download it on your phone and you can have access to everything that you have online on your dashboard but at your fingertips so without me continuing to blabber on let's get into this almost what's going to be like a tutorial [Music] so what I'll be doing is that I will be recording on here on my camera but I will also be screen recording so you'll see both of us at the same time now this right here is the main landing page for Trello really what it allows you to do is that it allows you to organize pretty much everything that you have going on and it also allows you to collaborate with other people so let's say you are working with a team all of you in the team can log onto Trello you can share what are called boards which is kind of like let's say chat groups where you post different things regarding what you're working on whether it's projects you'll see how I use it and it's gonna make a lot more sense but yeah Trello lets you invite a lot of people so that you can all have access to this dashboard where everyone knows exactly what's going on as you can see right here you can work with your team it also allows you to have information at your fingertips with the mobile app which is really convenient and one of the things that I absolutely love so what I'm gonna do right now is that I'm actually going to log on to my account so that you can see exactly how I'm using it so obviously I have an incognito here so that you can see what it actually looks like when you're now logged on so let's say you create an account it's completely free once you log in it's gonna be looking something like this so the first thing that you're going to do and again the way that I use this is for organizing pretty much all of my leads and everything that I have going on real estate-related so I will go on boards so you go on there and then I will create a new board so right here for the sake of this video let's say I'm naming it real estate organization and it gives you the option if you want to create it for your team or if you just want to do it for yourself so let's say I'm just going to do it for myself you can make a private or public for this case specifically I'm going to make it private because if you're going to do this yourself you to want to make it private since it's just something that's going to be for you or anybody that you invite to see your board so now we're gonna hit create board you can actually change the background if you go right here to the right change background you can add your custom picture to it you can go on your photos you can pick a color let's say I'm going to go under photos let's pick four examples homes so we're gonna pick let's scroll down in I don't know we'll just use this one that way you can actually that one does not look that appealing we'll use this one this one's really nice okay so this obviously since it's real estate we want to put a house in the background again you can pick whatever it is that you want so now that we've changed our background what we're gonna do is that we're going to start creating different lists now these lists imagine it being almost like tabs in a notebook and this is where you're going to keep all of the information that you want to refer to or keep organized so the first list that we're going to do is going to be the to-do list and again Trello and this is something that you're going to be looking at every single day whether it's on your dashboard on your computer or on your phone so we have a to-do list we have let's say hot leads cold leads warm leads active transactions open houses sign calls referrals you guys get the idea I'm just gonna do those lists because I could keep on going on and on but I want you just to get the gist of it so now we're going to do the to-do lists now one thing that I like to do is that and that you can do for each of these is that you can put a cover picture so for this card the very first one this is where I'm going to be posting that cover photo so the cover photo is just pretty much what the list name is but in a picture so it can stand out and they'll be more appealing to your eye once you're scrolling through trying to find out the tab that you're looking for so let's say we're going to do the two the to do so the card is just going to say to-do list for today or whatever it is that you want to name it and then enter you're going to double click it and it's gonna take you to this so we're going to go to the right and we're going to add cover so right here is where we add covers and you can upload a picture if you would like what I have done is that I have gone on canva and I have created my own pictures you can also just use one of the ones that the platform has provided but let's say I'm going to upload a cover image so this is these are all my files let's say I think I have one of two do I do here it is because again everything that I'm showing you right now is exactly what I have in what I do on my Trello can see there you go so now that is a cover picture for that list so we're just gonna close out of there so let's say we're going to do this day by day and again this is the to-do list so you just you're just going to add everything that you need to do is going to be its own card so for today we're going to do create a social media post for listing now let's say you actually want to set a deadline for that you're going to double click on that and then on the right right there you see it says due date so let's say today is one say I'm filming this right now it's 8 o'clock at night but let's say I want this due tomorrow tomorrow Thursday the 9th at 4:00 p.m.", "metadata": {"views":

Lo and behold, I found this great app for 10 bucks. But as a Vibe engineer, I didn't pay for it. Instead, I spent 3 days, $500 in claude credits, and missed my kids' baseball game over the weekend to build a crappier version from scratch. Developers are living in weird times as some of us are becoming less productive and ditching AI altogether. Like the streamer coding garden just completely destroyed the grift in this video. &gt;&gt; And it's not fun. It's not fun at all. But many others are going allin and seeing productivity gains like never before. Every employee at multi-trillion dollar company Nvidia is now AI enabled. &gt;&gt; Every one of our engineers 100% is now assisted by AI coders and our productivity has gone up incredibly. &gt;&gt; The truth is that AI does suck. It's like gambling. When you prompt it and the code actually works, you feel that indescribable rush of dopamine. &gt;&gt; I'm coming day and night. I mean, it's terrific. But eventually your prompt won't work and this leads to a vicious cycle that I like to call the prompt treadmill of hell where you keep burning through credits but never actually get what you need.

In today's video, we'll look at seven MCP servers every dev needs to know about to make AI coding suck less. It is October 14th, 2025, and you're watching the code report. I think it's safe to say that the majority of programmers are now using AI in some capacity, but very few are using it to its full potential. If you don't already have a couple of MCP servers hooked up to claude code, cursor, open code, or whatever you prefer, you're falling behind and you're not going to make it. But what even is a model context protocol server? Well, in one sentence, it's a standardized way for your coding agent to talk to external systems. That could be an app running on your local machine. It could be a remote server that runs your code. or it could be a thirdparty API. To understand its full potential, let's look at some examples. On this channel, I've complained endlessly about AI not being able to generate proper spelt 5 code. Well, luckily, just a few days ago, that problem has been solved thanks to the release of the spelt MCP server. All you have to do is install this bad boy in your favorite coding tool, like I'm using Claude Code here. And now, instead of going in blind, you can start a prompt with /spelt. This will automatically tell Claude how to get the right spelt documentation. And more importantly, use the spelt autofixer.", "metadata": {"views": 663000, "duration": 344, "tags": []}}

And now, instead of going in blind, you can start a prompt with /spelt. This will automatically tell Claude how to get the right spelt documentation. And more importantly, use the spelt autofixer. It'll perform a static analysis on the code and delopify it when the LLM hallucinates random ReactJS code in your project. But if you're a front-end developer, the most time-conuming task is implementing your designer's Figma files into actual code. Well, not anymore. The Figma MCP server allows you to connect your local Figma app on the desktop or in the cloud. It'll pull a design file and automatically implement it in HTML and CSS. You can even generate React components, use Tailwind, or build iOS UI elements using Figma's more reliable tooling. Pretty cool. But what if you're building something like a payment system with a third-party API? If this is something you really can't afford to screw up, well, Stripe and many other APIs now have an MCP server that can fetch documentation for the exact API version you're using. Not only that, but it has a long list of tools you can use to access live data in Stripe, opening the door to all sorts of possibilities, like accidentally refunding 10,000 customers with a single prompt. Now, even if you leverage these tools, your code is still probably going to break in unexpected ways at runtime. If you use a monitoring tool like Sentry, you can access all of the issues and errors your AI assistant missed before deploying.", "metadata": {"views": 663000, "duration": 344, "tags": []}}

If you use a monitoring tool like Sentry, you can access all of the issues and errors your AI assistant missed before deploying. Instead of trying to understand the slop you rolled out a few minutes ago, you just tell it to query the Sentry issues and fix them on the fly. That's helpful, but not all runtime issues can be caught. At other times, it might be the QA guy who worked at Blizzard for 7 years who assigns you a Jira ticket to fix some pointless edge case he found, in which case you'll want to have the Atlassian or GitHub MCP server installed. You can use it to automatically pull issues and tickets without ever needing to read them yourself. Just run a prompt that tells the AI to fix the issue and close the ticket while you sit on the train reading your favorite book. That's awesome. And if you follow this guide, you'll eventually have a billion-dollar app that requires more infrastructure to scale. There are now MCP servers for AWS, Cloudflare, Verscell, and many others that can let AI provision the actual resources you use in the cloud. In theory, the great thing about robots is that they won't forget to shut down an EC2 instance that will destroy your finances, but don't quote me on that.

What I'm going to do though is we're going to give it a prompt from the beginning. Okay? I'm going to give it something interesting. Now, one of the core things that's really valuable here is not to be overly restrictive in your initial prompt. What you can do if you like is if you go online and let's just say that you find, okay, something that you like and you're thinking, Jack, I really love the design of this. So, for example, I come to apple.com, right? And let's just say we're on Apple and we really love the design and UI that Apple has. Well, one of the things that we can do is we can just copy and paste that and throw that into Gemini as, hey, copy this user interface exactly and it will follow those instructions. It's very, very cool. So, what we're going to do is give it a prompt. And what we're going to do in this video is pretty much recreate my newsletter signup to make it very, very crisp. So, I would like you to design for me a beautiful, gorgeous, futuristic, highly stylized, simple landing page for a newsletter. The objective of the newsletter is to get somebody to sign up and join it.", "metadata": {"views": 10000, "duration": 1649, "tags": []}}

Quick little hack for you here as well is you'll see these cards on the right hand side, which is you can it basically suggestions that it thinks might be valuable to you. The other thing that I would definitely recommend that you do is if you've got a specific color scheme, enter that into the left hand side. But personally, what I prefer to do with this is give Gemini creative freedom and then direct from its creative freedom because a lot of times when you're giving it specific feedback, you're not actually enhancing it. So here we've got enable your app to see and understand images. Allow users to upload photo and receipts. So it just gives you different ideas here. Okay, let's have a look. Include prominent email signup forms to capture interest. Beautiful. Let's make sure we add that one in there. Come down to text generations to exact needs. Save custom instructions.

They'll show you, oh, this is really cool, but it doesn't do anything. It's not connected to anything. It's not it's not it's just basically living in its own bit. I'm going to show you how you can take this and actually publish it on its own domain, just like I did on this website here, which as you can see is at a unique domain. And I'm going to show you exactly how you do all those things step by step because it is literally insane. So I'm going to come back over here and let it finish its beautiful uh design. And oh my goodness, guys, just like this. Look at this. Upgrade your intellect. This is crazy. Okay, so first thing I'm going to do is go full screen. Okay, so you can see the kind of vibe it's got. Guys, this is really really impressive. Like genuinely insane. So we've got upgrade your intellect.

You can link this to various different things, your your blogs and whatnot. And then we've got these things down at the bottom, which is very, very cool. Now, once it's given the initial design and you're happy with it, there's a couple things that we're going to want to do here. So, the first thing is to give it some more context about who you are. So, what I'm going to do is come to my own newsletter here. I'm actually going to copy this. So, for example, if you've got a landing page, you've got sales copy, you've got anything that really captures it, the thing that you do, I want you to do it. We're going to go into solving the copy problem later, but this is just to give it a really good structure. where Gemini shines and we're gonna be using a different role soon is really just in terms of its its ability to really craft these gorgeous interfaces.", "metadata": {"views": 10000, "duration": 1649, "tags": []}}

Okay, there you go. And we enter this in and then we just basically hit bam. And then this is going to go and do it. And again, we just basically flirt with it a little bit until we get the design and the general feel to a standard that we're very, very happy with. And just speaking frankly with you for a second, guys, one of the things that people aren't talking about enough of this stuff is the kind of animation set that it has. Like it's this ability to not just be like this dynamic feel. Like for example, in this one here, we have the different blobs and globules moving around. You can literally give it that kind of almost three-dimensional feel based on the prompts. And Gemini is really good at doing that. It it it it almost feels like a significant step change because it is because it is just literally that much better. And oh my gosh, guys, just like that. Okay, do you know what? This is actually dangerous. And it's dangerous because I've already just finished my design and now I'm seeing a new design. I'm like, you know what?

It's almost like the value prop because one of the things I don't like about email is the fact that you get also by the way people who read usually like this their average income is significantly higher right so email is a really good channel for that so one email one big idea very cool value proposition every week I share the most valuable insights that I've learned whether it's by AI business tech or building things people want 3 minutes to read stuff I don't share everyone else that is my that is my email list that's my value prop people come in they enter their email no spam unsubscribe anytime 100% valuable so for example what you could do is if you you can do annotations on this as if it's like, you know, what's it? If it's like, you know, we want to be really specific about what you're talking about. And then we've got this thing. It's actually created for me, guys.

And you know it could be you know find like Jack's latest whatever the AI thing is that we want. We've got something from Harding and Jack. So this is about me my background and then we have an image there. You hover hover over and it does some cool stuff. And if you want to go deeper you can come and join the community or if you want to become an native business and work with me in boxing time in you can come and do that there and kick some butt and then weekly insights. Really cool. Basically you play around with it. I've typically found you know it's about 8 to 9 back and forth until you get to the point we very happy. But what we're going to do now is now we're happy with this. The question becomes, how do I get this onto a website? And then how do I get it to a point where you can actually access it? Well, the first step in that is downloading it. So we're going to excuse not copy. We are going to save it, which is done.

It looks really intimidating, but these are just folders to do different things. That's all it is. and anything you see in front end just got little bities like you know different you know files and features and components you don't need to understand all of it you really don't but just know that it's got code that's basically it's just got code that we're going to edit so what's the next step well it's fine to play around with it in the inline editor but it's actually if you want to take this to another level and leverage clawed code and a few other things we're going to want to do this on our laptop so you need to do two three very simple steps the first thing I want you to done is come over and download cursor. Again, I'll put the links down below so you can press the buttons. And if you've never used cloud code before, I'll put a link to a video on screen that you can watch that will go through exactly how you set up code, build it, deploy it because it is really like one of the most profitable things you can possibly do.

I was like, \"This is crazy.\" But the point is, we've come so far now that you never need to do that, right? So, basically, it's like enables you to kind of feel like you're in the Matrix. And I'll show what it looks like in a second. The next thing I want you to do is go ahead and download this particular app. Now, this app is called Node.js. So, in the same way that we're able to manipulate things online, Node.js JS will enable Claude on our laptop to move things around. So, you're going to download Node.js. And then the final thing you're going to do is come to this website here and copy this code here. Now, here's the next thing I want you to do. You're going to open up the terminal on your laptop. And you do by pressing command and two. Okay? And then you're going to copy in that code. Now, once you do that, this will then download code into your laptop. And you can give it different instructions then, right? So, say for example, you want to chat with Claude code. You can do anything. I could say to activate it, we just type in the word Claude.

But this is really important because this is actually how we get it to write incredible copy, right? I could say, \"Hey, what date is it?\" Okay, it can create files on computer. But the key point is this is that claude code can edit things on your laptop very easily. Okay? So you can give it directory and it can now edit the code. But the problem with this is that we kind of want to see a bit more of a better visual interface. And again, people are split between the terminal and cursor. But here's the thing I want you to do. And once you open up cursor, you're going to see something like this. So I'm going to come down here and click on file and click on open folder. And we're going to select the thing that we just downloaded, which is in a zip. So let me just open that real quick. Okay. So I've just unzipped it. I come down to open folder. And I come down to my downloads. And then it's ideas of Jack. And you just hit enter. Now, what's really cool here is this is everything that we saw on Gemini. But here's the difference.

Going to click on show terminal. Okay, this is the same thing that we just asked that we used to ask today, but it's within cursor. So we just type in Claude like so. This summons Claude. We click one for okay. This on the right hand side is cursor's inbuilt editor. So you could do the exact same thing without it, but we like it. So one of the things I want you to do first of all is ask it to do a full review of the code. So I want you to do shift and tab and this is going to put it into planning mode. This is a better way for you to provide images. It was my experience in using Gemini that when you gave it images sometimes it did it but sometimes it didn't. This is a way better way of doing it. So check this out. Hey then I would like you to review the entire website and I would like you to come up with a plan of all the ways that we can improve the copy and the design. The purpose of it is to articulate the clear value proposition and encourage people to sign up without being spammy and without just getting straight to the point and adding value. So we give it a prompt that looks like this. Now we hit enter. Now we can put Claude into planning mode.

It needs to exist to deliver an outcome for you or for your clients. Correct? So what we do by putting Claude in plan mode is we're using its kind of executive decision-making executive planning functions to review ruthlessly all of the carpet to see exactly how it can be built. And when this is complete, it's going to give us a step-by-step list of instructions. So we're leveraging the design capabilities of Gemini. And then we've got the thinking and the planning of Claude as well as the editability to make this incredible and beautiful. After a couple minutes of planning, it then comes up with a list of things which is really good because Claude's going to ask you some clarification questions. So first of all, what's your prov primary conversion goal for the website? Is it newsletter signups, qualified leader, paid offerings, or both equally? So you could say for example, okay, I want both equally and just go up and down. And it says, what type of improvements are you most interested in? Copy messaging design visual hierarchy.

And I'd say we want a kind of current balance. I think is fine. Do you have testimonials, subscriber feedback, or specific results that you can showcase? I do, but let's just say, for example, we're going to keep it minimal. And we're happy with that. Click on submit answers. And then it will run forth and crush it. By the way, I know a lot of people that run newsletters. They said one of their best performing conversions, typically speaking, are sharing like a testimonial from somebody inside the newsletter when they run ads. So, for example, something like, \"Hey, this testimonial made me the most prolific AI guy in my office. I had feedback from somebody accelerator that was very, very cool because knowing a little bit of AI and whatever you do can really accelerate you.\" So, what's happening now is Claude is doing his work in the background is going to make his improvements.

We just say yes, we're happy with that. Accept the auto edits. Again, the cool thing is you can either say yes, no, maybe. And just make your decisions. Beautiful. And just like that, it has finished implementation. One cool thing you can do is say cool, open it up for me to view. You can do this and it'll give you a link that you can just click and it will open up for you automatically. Now, one of the things that you're going to want to do is basically replace all of the information like your LinkedIn profile, your Instagram, all that sort of stuff.

And then we've got uh a little bit of a photo which we can change very easily. Is this for you guys? Look how freaking Claude added all the stuff in because I asked it to think about how we could make it better. Perfect for entrepreneurs and building, not for people who looking. Yeah, dude. really freaking cool. Now the next thing we want to do, okay, essentially is to connect this, which brings on to the third in our drive framework, which is to implement and automate. So effectively, what we want to do is the second they fill out this email, we want to essentially add them to some kind of mailing list. So how do we then connect this cool app with a mailing list? Well, for that we can use either make.com, nan or zapia. Just for simplicity, I'm going to be using.com in this video, but the process between make and nan is exactly the same.

We're going to go. Awesome. I come back over. I'm going to refresh it and do the same thing again with this email address. Send me the ideas. Bam. I come back over, guys. Check this out. There's my email address. How freaking crazy is this? Now, the cool thing is is that we can now add this to our email provider of choice. Now, if you if you're somebody wants to grow your mailing list, one of the things I recommend that we personally find very helpful is a platform called, and you know, I'm only ever going to show you the stuff that I personally use, okay? Is Beehive. Basically, app.behive.com. So, what we need to do is just test that it works, right? So, I'm going to come down here. One of the cool benefits, obviously, you can build anything in in any 10. If you're a beginner, you just want to get this started, you can do this easily. They've got a beehive module. You just click on create a subscriber really easily. I come down to email address. I can just enter in like test 555 or whatever it is atlook.com. You can select the source.", "metadata": {"views": 10000, "duration": 1649, "tags": []}}

And then we can send them a bespoke welcome email and then give them the beautiful um information they need to as part of a whole entire sequence. And this then kindly brings on to step four, which stands to validate and implement. So, what we're going to do now is we've got all this stuff on our laptop, right? What we kind of need to do is to upgrade it. But one thing I want to do before that is to show you how you tackle images because somebody in the community um literally said to me today that they were building in cursor. They're building with claw code but they were struggling with images. So I I promised I'd add this in as a bit of for instance a bit of a help. So what we can do is we can actually drag and drop photos of ourselves. So let me just show you as a for instance.

Okay, we hit that one in and now it will add it for us automatically cuz we're going to do all of this stuff and then that's how you actually go ahead and change. We say yep, that's completely fine. And remember, the second it does something, it will update for us instantaneously, which means it will see it here. So this guy with the ring light will disappear and then we'll see an image of me. Now, while it's working on that in the background, I'm going to show you how we now take this forward and publish it. One of the things we're going to do, guys, is we're going to use GitHub. Okay. Now, GitHub is just what we call a repository. Just a really fancy way of saying it's a place where we can take all of the files here and put them online. That means that we can then use those files for various different things, different bits and pieces. This has said that it's completed it. Let's come over and just validate that's happened real quick. I scroll down and where are we? We can see that that has been updated.", "metadata": {"views": 10000, "duration": 1649, "tags": []}}

So, what we're going to do is I'm going to come over here and I'm going to give it a prompt like, \"Awesome. I would now like to publish this on GitHub. Let me know everything that you need to know from me to make that happen.\" Dead simple. Obviously, I've got specific processes, but I just want to kind of illustrate how helpful Claude is cuz not only is it taking actions on the code level for us, so we can use Gemini 3.0 and all this beautiful code, it's actually helpful in the delivering of the thing. So, we're going to use a couple of things here. So, it's going to come down here. It gives you instructions of exactly what to do. So, it wants you to create a new repo. Okay, which is awesome. And make it public. So, that's what we're doing. We're going to come back over. We're going to head over to GitHub. And then let's go on to new. We're going to give it a different name. We're going to call this one ideas with Jack 2. Okay. Description is a cool newsletter button. And then we're going to keep it public. And you click create repo. Obviously, it's completely free to sign up. I'm going to come back here and I'm going to say we're going to copy this git. Beautiful.", "metadata": {"views": 10000, "duration": 1649, "tags": []}}

So we just give that hot second and then it will work its magic. And just like that guys we've got the prompt. We just click on allow. We have continue to GitHub and this will open up a brand new thing. We just sign into our beautiful GitHub. Click confirm and then we just give it a unique code. We're going to come down and we're going to generate a token. This token we then provide to cursor. We're going to come back here. We give it a token like so, which is fantastic. And then it'll be live on GitHub. And this leads us on to the final part of this step for the process of the view is we're going to now need a place to put it, which we're going to use something called Versel. Now, there's a couple different options. You can use Versal, you can use uh Netlefi. Lovable for example, whenever you publish something on lovable, you'll see that it lists on netifle. These are just services that let us take that code and display it on the internet, which is cool. So if I show you this ideas of Jack thing, basically what you do on Versel again completely free is you connect it to GitHub.

But again, you just connect this thing to GitHub. I don't see on this screen because I've already connected it, but as soon as you connect it to GitHub, anytime you upload a repo, it will then appear in Vel for you. So for example, this is now saying that it's done. So, if I click on this link, this should then open it up to our GitHub repo. And look at this, guys. Every single thing that we had in our desktop is now available here. How freaking cool is that? That is literally insane. So, if I come back over to Vela, for example, what we're looking for is the thing. If I come down here, I'm going to add in a new project. Okay, look at this. Git repository. It's found it instantaneously. Okay, you can also add new GitHub account here. Very cool. So, all I do is this is loading up real quick. So, we give this a hot second and there we go. We've got it here with the name that we gave it. Click on import like so and we click on deploy.

Then once this is done, we can actually physically see it and it is going to be literally insane. And bam, guys, just like that. So if I click on it, I open it up and now we have a full app that is completely live, that is completely fully functional. But it doesn't just stop there cuz now we need to get a domain address for it. Right? So if I come back over here, I click on add domain right here. You come on domains on the left and you click on buy domain. It opens up a new site like this. You can type in, say, for example, ideas byjack.com and you go $1125. You add it. It is preposterously simple. you buy it. And just to show you what this looks like on my side, so you can get a good sense of what it looks like once you've bought it cuz like it's like 10 bucks.

"chunk_index": 0, "text": "in the previous video we talked about enterprise canvas a service model a model of how services work as a kind of checklist of how our service works together as a whole in this video what to look at how various support services work in relation to a given service remember that if we think of this as the service as a whole then we can divide it in terms of what happens before during and after a major activity a transaction for example and value creation in this case and then stuff that is about stuff going out and on the other side's about things coming in the interactions that are coming there so if we look at it as a whole there are classically a bunch of Direction services or guidance services that talk about how we are going to direct this given service so it's derived from a classic model called viable system model which you you may or may not know but it's worth looking up I'll include a link on that in the description box in the YouTube description so for any given service there are three timescales that we're dealing with which roughly speaking break down to strategy tactic tactics and operations so if we break this into three parts this is what's classically considered to be management there is line management which were is about runtime is about management of operations there is management about the tactics about what we're going to do in the future rather than what's happening right now so as a tactical operation which is also about looking at the outside world so I'll look at looking outside there's operations which is looking mostly inside and there's also strategy which is about it's about identity and purpose and wealth we talked in the previous one about values values are what are derived from identity and purpose and they're the things that guide strategy so this is the direction services they provide direction for whatever service were on at different time scales now as a service operates it's going to need some kind of coordination so we have another group of services that are the coordination services and again there are three sets of these that deal with runtime coordination about the connection between the running of the service itself and the operations running which again is giving us the connection outside particularly it's the coordination of what happens in relation to those interactions that we saw before about what happens before during and after so that's dealing with those coordination points here about how we connect to someone else and onward to someone else there's also so that's the runtime coordination then we have coordination of change which is classically for example the project management office or anything else that's dealing with the process of change itself so that's going to coordinate between operations and tactics it's helping getting the information from the tactics to help change and the third one is about is again change of strategy a strategic change which connects is a bridge provides a coordination of bridge between strategy and tactics so that's typically the portfolio management office or things like enterprise architecture but again these are dealing with connections to others particularly this is looking outside this is looking inside this is looking at the runtime issues so on another side we have a whole bunch of services that deal with quality I call them the validation services but the crucial thing to realized is it's how are we going to manage quality and we have a larger number of support and validation there we may have a very large number of these services like secure service for security services for quality services for environment services for safety every time we have some kind of qualitative concern we're going to have one of these so there could be quite a lot of them and these again split in different ways these DIF the first one is why is it important so it's build awareness that the quality is important and that's often things like posters and so on but also just engaging people there is build capability to enact that's the capability to enact to support that quality so I do actions at runtime to make sure that I'm keeping on track to purpose other than keeping on track to that qualitative construction certain and the other one is continuous review and improve so whenever we finish an action and there's a another video about this about after-action review whenever we do an action we need to review against the qualitative concerns so these again they connect somewhat with each of these musti for coordination of doing training coordination of of connections to the purpose particularly they're connecting to the strategic and identity because that's where those concerns come from these are interacting with stress strategic change and these can occur or coordinate at runtime but the review is particularly happening after that's building the before connect making sure that before is connected capability is making sure that it's going to happen at runtime so we're building awareness building capability building and reviewing and improving continuously on the basis of what's happening here and as I say everyone every qualitative concern safety security but sustainability financial probity ethics said security many many others depending on what the industry is what the concerns will be those are covered by things like standards which is how we're going to review them so there are a whole bunch of support services in relation to our main service we also have another group of support services particularly about investor and beneficiary now investors are not necessarily monetary for example if you're working for a company then the company is an investor in your family otherwise you're not going to be available for the company to work in the company likewise your family is an investor in your place in the company it's interesting in that the flow if it's monetary flow it's like a customer but it goes the like a supplier but it goes the opposite direction and in the same way for a beneficiary it's like a customer but it goes in the opposite direction it's coming in to it and these are connecting particularly with value governance to make sure that it's balanced and fair if we don't have it balanced and fair it will break it was a very common cause of failure in organizations and a classic example of that is where everyone is investing anyone in a community is investing in a company but all the money is transferred only to the financial investors that's a classic cause of complete failure for an organization so whenever we look at a service if the core of the service and each one of them is split up in multiple ways so each one of these services within service every given service must have these support services in order for that for that for that service to be viable it needs direction it needs coordination it needs validation it's likely to need investors and it's likely to have beneficiaries who are supported by that service in a way that is different from the basic value flow so overall if you if we saw in the previous video about how Enterprise campus provides a checklist for services themselves this provides a checklist for how what all the supports verses are that are required to create viability so this provides a viability checklist for any service if these aren't here then that service will fail so we need to understand what these services all are how they interrelate with this services and their jur they are support services not control services this is a fundamental issue that a lot of people think management is it about control well it's just another support service thanks for

"chunk_index": 0, "text": "in this video I want to explore a model called Enterprise canvas which is a checklist for making sense of services in fact we treat everything as a service in enterprise canvas so the starting idea is that for anything there is a atten whenever we want to do anything there is a tension between what we have the realized ends as opposed to what we want to get towards which is our desired ends and to make that happen we have some means we need some means to make that happen which we might call a service but that's the means by which something can happen that's a service we're creating a service for ourselves we're serving our needs now in try reaching towards making our needs happen we may call on someone else we might call a supplier classically and likewise when we're working towards our ends we might be able to help someone else that's what we would call a customer and you'll notice that it's completely symmetric a customer who may have a customer a supplier may have a supplier so it's working in a completely consistent way now in the same way that we have our desired ends our supplier has their own desired ends they're reaching towards their own ends as well and the same is true for our customer and one of the things that makes it work is that there is some kind of connection between what we're reaching towards and what our customer is reaching towards are the same from the supplier side they're not necessarily the same desired ends but there will be some relationship between them usually a connection of values vision and values are shared in some way so to make sense of our own services and service relationships we need to look at what those value as connections are this is a flow of value we're creating value in some way for someone else at the same time as building towards making ours so it's a flow of value that continues onward in both directions look what we look at this we can start saying well the stuff that we happen that we need to do before we create value that's for example the value proposition is a classic example of that how we propose to deliver value some people describe value proposition as being a fancy name for your services or products well no because it's connecting the value to the values connecting to the story then it makes it up so and we also have stuff that follows after so for example that's what we might call value governance we'll come back to that in a moment but we then have other supplier facing services services that are facing the stuff coming in and services that are facing the customer side stuff going out so there are interactions so when we look at the supplier they're actually the same as well they have their own value proposition their own fairly production the the value creation and the same is true on the customer side so again it's completely symmetrical it's just everything is a service which we view in the same way so there are interactions that happen before a service delivery which very much go both ways we are this is for example procurement and that's marketing building a sales relationship there's a main flow that happens during the transaction and there's a kind of flow that typically happens afterwards such as in a commercial environment you get paid or you pay your supplier so another video that we have on this set is about the service cycle about what happens during these interactions there's a connecting to the overall purpose connecting to a conversation connecting to building relationships run the actual transaction and then unpacking it all the way back so that we make sure we've connected katana completion in relation to the story so there's an overall flow there now between each of these services whenever there is a boundary there is going to be some kind of product it's mark it denotes the boundary so for example we're passing a product through here to use in our service we're passing products around brochures and so on we're passing bills and so on and bills invoices and payments are going through there so these are products which are static things as opposed to services which are activities so this side is out for the outgoing facing this is the incoming facing and you can see it's exactly the same but it also means that each of these is a service in its own right so we can look at these as being a service which has if it's a service it has the same structure internally as well there are services that are coming in their interactions that are going both ways there it's providing services that's coming back in so it's fractal in that sense exactly the same patterns happens exactly the same way every service contains other services in fact even within here there's going to be services within services which is what we talk and call about a decomposition of services or an aggregation as it comes together so we can look at every interaction every service in exactly the same way regardless of scope scale content or context it provides us with a completely consistent way of making sense of service relationships so that's the core of enterprise canvas in the next video we'll look at how governance happens how management happens how weather the relationships are for example with investors and beneficiaries so this is the core of everything seen as a service it provides a checklist that we can make sense of what's going on we look for what are the realized ends the desired ends what are the connections of you values that connect us to our suppliers and customers what are the products that are going to occur at the boundaries what are the means by which we deliver value by which we deliver value to others or bring in value from others so it's a simple checklist that we can use for any type of service and say the next part we'll look at this in more detail the netting how the actual governance and coordination happens but that's for something for the next video for here we've just got this overall checklist about how everything works together thanks for watching do look at the youtube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other

"text": "a conversation the other day with Miguel a beau reminded me of a recurrent problem in enterprise architecture around fixed ideas of time scale as though there's only one time scale that exists but if this often assumes that that's just for example you know the longest time scale we deal with is two years but most if you look at something like the classic ei frameworks like TOGAF they're actually designed for that kind of process that kind of approach but the reality is that we have a huge range of timescales all interweaving with each other so for example some industries I have specific timescales health for example is by definition life in fact quite often longer than life if we're looking at things like hippy epidemiology so we have to be thinking in terms of holding data on someone health information for a hundred years or more whereas most of the devices the little sort of Fitbit and so on know things about what's going to happen when those devices die because there's no way of getting the information back out of there and putting it into somewhere more useful but health is in a hundred years sounds ridiculously long too many business people but that's actually what we're dealing with and yet when we look at something like civil engineering those timescales can go back hundreds of years I think I mentioned in a previous video that parts of the london sewerage system are actually Rumer they're 2,000 years old these are practical issues that we need to consider if we're working in those domains IT looks a very short term by comparison we also got some context specific challenges for example in telecoms we have very real challenges around the speed of light when we're looking at information going out back to or to a satellite or for that matter when we're dealing with them incredibly small distances involved in in the internal workings of a computer Admiral grace hopper the inventor of COBOL you still walk around with sticks that were about that long the strings are wire because that's the distance that light travels in a nanosecond when you're dealing with time scales that small these become very real issues another one in terms of my own business my own range the shortest time scale I would routinely deal with this probably stopped microsecond but the longest time scale I've had to deal with as an actual business issue was a quarter of a million years because we were labeled enabling hazardous goods or looking at issues around labeling of hazardous Goods and in the case of nuclear waste we're talking about that kind of time scale literally ten times longer than recorded human history when we have to put up a sign that says don't touch and we genuinely mean don't touch that what we're dealing with forever chemicals in principle by according to the legislation we have to label it forever that's an interesting challenge fairly obviously we marked it as non-compliant but non-compliant doesn't mean that it disappears it means that we have to come back and look at it again and again and again until we can finally way to make it work so these are real timescales that occur in real business environments as I said mine range from sub microsecond to a quarter of a million years other people may well have longer in each duration the other one which came up particularly in that conversation is the fractality of timescales we tend to think of strategy tactics operations in a very fixed way that strategy is sort of the big picture has a longer time scale and tactics gets smaller and then weed operations is very much focused around that now but a useful way of looking at that in terms of scan certainly and that's a useful way to frame it is in terms of that strategy is kind of above the plan stage strategy is the big picture where does it fit in relation to the two whole dynamically changing over time the plan phase is the before we do action that's where tactics tends to sit and operations is in the during phase but notice that this can have multiple there was this pattern will stay the same across multiple time scales so that someone's someone else's strategy could be our operations if we're doing strategy it actually is our operations it's someone else's operations could well be our strategy so notice how these all interweave with each other the boundaries are very much ones that we choose also note that there are two fixed points here on one end there's the enterprise the vision the one the anchor that we use which should in principle always stay the same at the other end there's the transition from the now to the past once we go past that traveling now we can't change it we can learn from it but we can't change the past itself and finally notice that we choose where those boundaries are they're not fixed points they're not fix things that strategy exists certainly their tactic certainly their operations gonna be there the boundaries of where we choose them to be this is something we'll see quite often do things like services where is the boundary of a service the answer is where we choose it to be so notice these boundaries that we choose them and therefore it's important to choose wisely", "metadata": {"views": 44, "duration": 350.0, "tags": []}}

"chunk_index": 0, "text": "another challenge that's come up for me personally during this pandemic but actually more general it's a question of digital legacy how do we protect our digital legacy and make it available to others once we pass on in the business environment this is called escrow we protect whether there's a promise to protect or provide support if the company that's providing the service goes under but it's this whole issue of digital legacy as a reminder to this particularly because a close colleague died last month and a lot of his friends and in fact me as well I'm running around trying to make sure that we protect his legacy before it vanishes thus he scores covered an enormous range over a very large number of years and touched so many different places that it's quite difficult to find where they all are in his case fortunately his family is actively supporting us but in other cases they may not offer maybe no family to support it so we each need personally to think about our own legacy prepare prep planning and preparation for escrow so I've split this into three distinct steps one of them is the stuff that we can do even without active permission which is things like protecting is it mostly short-term stuff particularly particularly things like domain names in the web hosting which can be forgotten or someone can be out of the country and be lost so using a team or a bunch of friends to make sure that there is money available to pay for these things which otherwise risk that parts of that part of the legacy just vanishing I've had web domains that have just died web sites have gone redundant changes in code that make it inaccessible I need to protect this stuff because I've got a lot of material in my case 1,200 Arctic twenty-five books fifty slide decks a hundred and fifty videos already all of these we need to protect somehow because some of it may be very useful to other people in the future so step one is making sure that even if we forget these crucial things that can vanish at a moment's notice if we're not careful that make sure at least those are protected step two it's about disability if we become disabled if we have a stroke for example or a car accident we can be out of action for a long time don't we don't actually die for these we need things like passwords I'm having making sure colleagues friends are trusted to prevent a trusted adviser a trusted agency has things like passwords has things like content backups so that those are available in the event that it goes further and that we can access that material or at least if nothing else that someone can put up a tweet on our behalf and say so-and-so is you know Tommy it's okay he's out of action for now but he's okay and step three arises on the point of death where in other words were someone let me I no longer have a choice about what happens to my legacy or no longer adding to it there are very real issues around things like death certificates there are certain things there are legal requirements and those are really important issues around family for example my colleagues following up on the death of this colleague they do they asked the family for support and the family have indeed given their support but a lot of a crucial agencies like a web hosting agency will not accept someone taking over a domain without a death certificate but to back it up and a death certificate may not be available for some weeks even maybe longer but during which time that that particular asset may be lost so we need to plan for this as well some key questions around digital legacy what are the choices on the legacy what do we choose to share why do we choose who do we understand but it might be useful for how can we let them know that it is still available but will still be available in the point of disability or death there are a whole bunch of so-called intellectual property issues things like one of the issues that we have in enterprise architecture is we have very few good case studies because when Enterprise Architecture is applied people either want to hide the bad ones or that the good ones have worked so well that it's part of the company's secret sauce so there are very real issues about how do we share material which is crucial to the to the development of the discipline but it still under commercial in confidence we need to have the right to access or it means to access those companies that say look can we publish this thing from 20 years ago which even though it's old and no longer relevant to you is seriously important to other people and the other one that we need to watch and we need to respect is the whole family issues there's a lot of issues around privacy I mean the part of my digital legacy would include photographs but they're often include photographs of other people who may not want to be part of that legacy there's privacy issues for family too a lot of the stuff I've written is very private it's very much embarrassed could be embarrassing angry at certain people that I don't really want to have that available oh no I don't want to show those up people up again for disputes that were 20 years ago and also there's an issue around income some of the legacy we have may be financially valuable and may be the only income that our families have it's important to respect and protect that and there's also related to things like big quests so one of the issues that's come up during the pandemic is a more generic one about digital legacy what are we doing to protect our digital legacy because we all have some one of the question planning that we need to do there's three steps about dealing with the short-term dealing with disability to do with death and what are the the challenges that we need to face the questions around what to share and what not what the IP issues are and also the family issues so take your own digital Legacy series because other people will need it even more than you will once you pass off", "metadata": {"views": 59, "duration": 399.0, "tags": []}}

it's proven so those are that's without the fail the meaning mistake is leaping straight into production but also another one is where we make an assumption and build a whole structure on it without actually checking that the assumptions were correct and this happens again a lot just as an example at the time I'm videoing this the corona virus pandemic has really shown the fragility of a just-in-time manufacture when half of you half of your supply chain is broken in some way or another so watch for the assumptions and that's what the meaning mistake and the discipline the word try to resolve that to get out of the meaning mistake is to check our assumptions in every stage the next one is what we call the position problem and that's that I have the truth there is a very strong tendency to have to be the consultant or the manager is the person who has the truth but there's no actual check it's just I possess this likewise it is correct that I possess the money and therefore you have to do what I say or we will convert everyone else's investment into money and then I can then take it because I have the rights to the money there are a lot of rights type problems that arise in that space another one another issue that arises is what we call the reality risk which is failure to realize that when you're working in an imaginary space when you're working with new ideas there is distinction between real and imaginary when you're imagining something it is as if it is real the danger which occurs in the reality risk is that people will assume that something which you they are working with as if true is itself true and then can upset what it turns out to be true when they thought it was only as if so there are some real issues here around what is real and what is not you know don't call for things that you want to be would like to be real without realizing the consequences if they become real we see a lot in that in politics for example as well as in business the number one simple example is don't wish for scaling if you're not ready for it there are very real issues they're about being ready for things when they change the defining one isn't quite so much of a sin as such but it's one that we see a lot which is what I call lost in the learning labyrinth the learning process is not a linear statement in your progression it's it has a lot of odd starts and finishes the beginner's luck moment that happens only at the beginning and that we don't get anywhere else again the classic one of the moment where there's a moment of absolute despair and then to sudden breakthrough and the mistake is thinking that that's on the moment of breakthrough is mastery when in fact it's only just the beginning of the journeyman's wrote well so there are lots of issues around there so those are our seven different mistake as seven different sins if you like the hype hubris about getting lost in the big hike about something the golden age which is making a grand assumption that assert something in the past or something in the imaginative future is going to be perfection the new-age nuisance where there's a complete absence of discipline at all there is the meaning mistake where we jump to assumptions and check there is the possession problem where we believe that we alone could have the rights to possess something rather than the responsibilities that go with it there's the reality risk of failing to make a clear difference between ears and as if it were certain that something is is true as if true are very different things it's really really important not to mix up and the risk of getting lost in the learning labyrinth the development stage there now it's a lot more in the blog posts and elsewhere that are listed in the description of YouTube do have a look at this because they will really help you avoid these traps in terms of moving around between the different skill sets and modes that are required so the way we resolve these is we need to keep track of what mode we are in at each time versus the mode that we need to be at each moment in time and move cleanly between them according to how we're doing it so that's the seven sins diagnostic it's a useful if very disturbing at times diagnostic to help avoid some of the traps that we walk into thanks for watching do look at the youtube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves", "metadata": {"views": 77, "duration": 569.0, "tags": []}}

0, "text": "another useful tool in terms of skills and mapping out skills is what we call the skill modes map this is a very simple to access framework historically actually derived from the work of Carl Jung but it's where things will describe it as the swamp metaphor because it's about we need different ways of working ways of thinking different ways of interacting at different stages in in any kind of work as well see it's not about individual people or the mode that each person belongs in though it's often we will need the different modes across a team but it's also people have a particular orientation yes but we've got to be able to handle all four modes in order to do the work it's called the swamp of metaphor because imagine a swamp it's not a little kind of bleak muddy mess it's just every possibility is there but if you try to stay too long in one place in the wrong in the wrong kind of place you'll disappear beneath the surface and be gone so we've got for quite different ways of working on modes mindsets that to work in that space the first if you like is the artist you run like hell you run like crazy you never get you're always getting lots and lots of new experiences this is where you get new ideas from but the moment you stop and say I've found my style there's a sad little bloopers you disappear beneath the surface and you also can't really connect ideas together they're just ideas without any kind of frame the next one it's the almost the opposite extreme it's the the believer it's about inner truth about inner absolute certainty it fits best with things in a serve it precedes not even as if something is true but it asserts that it is true we believe completely and this is what a trainee does needs to do we need to actually be able to do this the next one is so I think that one sticks a pole in a fixed place and there are people to climb up the pole a better view of the overview of the ground around them but you're not in touch with the swamp when you're up high up on a pole now the next mode is like making a platform what's such is the scientist where we've a platform between a bunch of poles otherwise known as the ivory towers of academia but the catch is that to do this we're making firm level ground you know in the swamp hobgoblins and FAL fields coming rushed away at the sound of the first myth being exploded and so on that kind of thing but the trouble is it's no longer the swamp it's no longer it actually shuts out new possibilities so that is a that's something we need that's the theory base but it isn't necessarily the answer to everything Enterprise Architecture for example about any form of architecture is every bit as much art as science it needs to find the right balance between them dynamically but we also got a group of people out on the edges of the platform or even further beyond who spread their weight on swab shoes they resolve the swamp but staying in one place for just long enough it's what we call the Builder or the engineer when the technologist for example is light waves or particles the answer is yes therefore no but I can use an idea rather than a certain truth I use it as if it is true rather than saying like the believer that it is true these are different approaches different attitudes different ways of working so when we look at them in terms of scan the the believer is what the training does it's down in that lower lift or the close to the action of the good certainty you've then got in the in the upper lift still dealing with certainty you've got the apprentice who is the same as the science same attitudes as the scientist the danger is when the science becomes a belief when we get into scientism which is not the same thing when we made the mistake of shifting over as if four is over on the upper right we have the the the builder the engineer we're solving different problems we're resolving uniqueness rather try to force things to fit and we also got the artist creating the new ideas now we have to be able to move between each of these dynamically it's not that one is better than another it's possibly true that one is better dynamically for one purpose than another which is an issue we'll come on to all the next video but overall we need all of those modes at some point during the development and production of anything in a business so look at these different modes the artist looking at inner value the believer looking at in a truth the the scientist looking at the truth in the outer world the built or engineer looking at out of volume the usefulness of things rather than arguing about the truth so it's a useful little model to map out what we need dynamically which mindsets we need dynamically because if we don't get the right one at the right time that's when things start to go wrong and we'll look at that in the next video thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and

"in the previous video we looked at this tool called the skills map which helps us map out what skills are going to be needed for what type of thing and what level of skill were likely to need as well so the levels we have there the the distance from action where a training is really minimal skill their route following rules that working at the point of action but apprentice is focusing their attention away from the point of action because they're learning theory they're learning rules they're relatively they're still low skilled rather but they're low skilled rather than minimal skill they're not at the point of action when they're doing that part of the work and said they're following following and extended rules that more theory than just rules a journeyman is the next level up has to be able to deal with higher levels of uncertainty actually beyond the boundary of certainty this is the first real level of skill as a person who simply rote learning they are dealing with patterns and guidelines those kind of areas those kind of mild mid-level uncertainties but they're still expecting to be supervised and also they're not while they're doing that while they're learning they're not at the point of action as opposed to a master who has to be able to deal with any level of uncertainty at the point of action now the learning sequence is actually the opposite of the classic science development sequence inside sweetie we talked about idea of hypothesis Theory law but it's actually the opposite way around the master is the one who's dealing with ideas the the journeyman is developing hypotheses it's dealing with with working out ideas but not actually there and the front of action this the the apprentice is still working on the theory part and the the trainee is working only on rules or law I was a huge that occurs between although on the one side the the feeling the idea so the idea of the law this fixed that it's awkwar-- we call the Harriet Harris's parity barrier so there's an issue there about the learning sequence is the opposite way around which means were going against the current all the time all of the focus in conventional trainee tight structures is to prevent people having new ideas that's not you know check your brain in that the door was the famous description of Taylorism the only their masters who in this case actually were just the theory the apprentices were setting the rules now that gives us another important problem because one of the huge dangers of the apprentice level is that it's now got just enough knowledge to understand I just never wanted to get into serious trouble but nothing like enough knowledge to be able to get out of it again they also have a much stronger notion that because they are bet quotes better than the trainee therefore they know everything now personally I've often had people who've just done a weekend workshop telling me that they know far more than anyone who's done it for 20 or 30 years this is a classic apprentice mistake we often get an enterprise architecture we often get people have just done the five-day don't care of course telling people who've been doing it for twenty years that they don't know anything because they haven't done TOGAF in my case I literally rewrote TOGAF from scratch to make it work for whole enterprise architecture and I still get people who told me that I don't understand Tokyo because they've just done the training course or whereas I did it ten years ago so there is a very real problem where we have apprentices who have just enough trouble to get enough knowledge to get into trouble and nothing lucky enough to get out of it so there's an issue there there's a similar clash actually between the trainee and the gentleman because the journeyman will do is that the apprentice doesn't know that so that the trainee doesn't understand and they are completely confused in the training see the other one is a very nasty little trap that when we compress time a lot we then have no time for apprentices or for journeyman we've got no time for those that we don't allow people time to learn or to practice there's no for high power efficiency we've got to be just doing the job and nothing else that gives us a culture or a context in which we only have a trainees on one hand and masters on the other and no means to get that for the trainees to the master level we can see this in a lot of organizations to the to production focused or focused too much on efficiency at the expense of actually being able to do the work they work fine until the Masters leave or retire they work fine as long as there's no change even when the Masters gone but the soon as there is any kind of change they fall apart in a heap so for enterprise architects of business architects we need to be really careful to ensure that there is the means to learn the job if that means it's gone then your business is incredibly fragile so that's what we can get from looking at the skills map is how much things have been compressed what the learning processes are as well as the skills mapping itself mapping across from the different

"chunk_index": 0, "text": "when things get disruptive it's easy to lose focus it's easy to get lost in panic or overt particularly when you're the only group out of a larger group that is suddenly having to deal with massive overload and also if your organization is mostly used to things being stable and always the same so it's very easy to get lost to panic the thing that helps keep the panic at bay is some kind of focus something that gives an anchor or more accurately something more like a sheet anchor in nautical terms in other words it's not something that holds us rigidly still but it gives us a sense of some sort of stability some sort of directional focus she thanked her is literally a sheet of a kind of parachute was dropped out of the back of a ship above a sailing sailing ship to keep it more stable than the heavy winds and heavy currents so one example of this one example of a focus the one I recommend most is a focus on vision values and principles know often for this the example I use is the TED Conference ideas worth spreading that's their big it tells us that the focus that we're going to work on is ideas that's the access from the focus area what activity is about spreading ideas and we concentrate on the ideas that are worth spray that's how that that first one about focusing on we're focusing on ideas helps us avoid scope creep we don't get lost trying to do something else the focus on spreading ideas means that we're again it helps us avoid scope creep or context loss but the other one about worth these are ideas that are worth spreading is that this tells us what the values are is the simple test is is this an idea that's worth spreading how do we assess whether this is worth spreading so that gives us a guidance of to test anything that's going on chaotic in a chaotic environment it seems like everything is possible what could be looking anywhere go crazy bring it back down to what is the focus of this business we deliver bread we do we focus on bread that matters bread that is good here's a good one for a baker we are in the story of and this is all worth that's useful that's well that's useful here is they the enterprise has story we are in the story of bread that is high quality bread that is worth eating bread that is gluten-free for example but which is maybe very important for some people to know that that's safe to eat in the midst of chaos we don't want to add someone who's having an allergy attack in the middle of a pandemic so we're using the vision the anglers anchor short anchor phrase what is everyone working with or working on what are you doing what are you doing relative to the big story in relation to that overall thing and how do you assess that it's worthwhile doing what is your measure of success that's gives you an anchor a vision it gives the values that fall out of that and the principles are the actionable values that we can then test am I on track to division am I on track to the values am i holding the values that's what we're doing there if we don't have a vision or if as is too often the case that the vision is actually just a marketing puff as in our vision is to be the biggest provider off it's not about you it's about the organize about the whole enterprise it's the view from the outside looking out and occasionally looking in rather than looking from the inside the organization looking out at what you can sell it's a quite different type of vision than the one that's usually described so it's not a marketing pitch week we are serving that and this is a where another useful one if you don't have a clear vision but useful one to focus on is the idea of service how do we serve who do we serve what is our service in what way do we serve the whole of the wider story if we're in a broader enterprise then playing a role in that enterprise how can we connect with all of the other players in that story to make it happen how do we make sure that others are there how can we support others who are struggling in our own shoshone enterprise because if they're struggling they're going to get us struggling eventually as well so it's in our interest to notice the whole story and how it connects what we can do to do to serve that story better sort of who do you serve you don't have business just solely to make shareholders make money that's oh really that's a side effect of doing your job well if you have shareholders it's not your job is not to make the bank happy your job is to do some kind of service to a broader enterprise you will keep the back happy by doing it properly but who do you serve what values define what services what do whenever you're in an interaction with others to make enough service happen what are your mutual responsibilities but classic terms and conditions it tends to be very one-sided it looks the world only from the organization's perspective to get service happening we need to be symmetrical to be balanced what are the checks and balances that make your service work how do you identify what is good or not good service what does good service look like what is not good service look like how do you tell the difference what could you do on the fly to maintain good service or to bend things towards serving in the way that you would like how do you maintain service when little bits of disruption are happening all around the place but for example a just-in-time manufacturing and just-in-time supply chain gives you a real problem there's some parts of the supply chain are randomly breaking it's going it means that you're going to need things like buffers in your system warehouses and so on to make this possible how are you going to deal with disruption in this little ways how can it maintain service so there's two focused themes that you can use to avoid to minimize and avoid the Govardhana the risk of falling into panic one of them is to keep a focus on vision values and principles another is to focus on the idea of service and how you serve your community your story", "metadata": {"views": 31, "duration": 403.0, "tags": []}}

"chunk_index": 0, "text": "one of the themes I'm seeing now is a sense of that after nearly three months it's all over it's it's coming to the end we've flattened the curve it's finished the reality unfortunately is that the current virus is anything but finished if we look at the history of other pandemics particularly the 1918 global flu the second wave was much worse than the first because people relaxed people thought it was over so there's a real danger about being lulled into thinking that it's all over and there's also not only the frustrations about being cooped up unfortunately a lot of politics we won't cover that at all it's just we notice that it's there so from a business perspective we really need to be thinking first about about thinking about what happens next when we get if we're going to get something anything like the 1918 flu which is lots of continuing action over lots of periods of time with sporadic changes so but before we do that we really need to review first we need to do an after-action review an after-action review the fundamentals are no blame and pinion stripes at the door no one is more important than anyone else everyone had a role to play we've had a very strong and especially this is that most of the so-called essential work in the coronavirus was people who are the lowest pay but still the most involved without which things don't happen so we need to get clear about what works so when we look at this for each of the actions what was supposed to happen was there a plan at all did we have a risk management plan if we didn't then we definitely need one what actually happened what's the actual information that we have about what went on do we have any information about what actually happened in our business in terms of the disruptions then we say what's the source of the difference what worked what didn't work giving equal importance to both not focusing on what didn't work but we focus on what did work as well and we look for the lessons learned what can we do differently next time if there's anything like this because bluntly there is going to be something like this so we then need to get ready for what's basically a random disruption this time around pretty much everything closed down in a on a countrywide basis in most cases but what we're coming up to is as we get better at track and trace there's going to be little random disruptions little hotspots flaring up which means that from widespread business you're going to have individual areas that suddenly don't work so it's a quite different kind of disruption it's always harder to work with so we need checklists relative in a fire environment what are your assets where are they located how can you move them to be better situated for a random change another one is to focus on fungibility in other words you can exactly interchangeability what can I swap in that will do the same job and particularly adaptability on-the-fly and we look at big natural disasters like the Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans there's a lot of requirement for ability to adapt I think is the head of Walmart said a lot of you are going to have to make decisions far above your level that's fine so but also what came out of that was the really important real importance of having support from the top as to what we're expected to do when we are having to do things differently from our normal way of working it's fine having us fixed set of rules and roles and responsibilities and reporting relationships when everything is stable when it's not we need a quite different way to do this and we need to know the difference between the two but if we look at an army for example in peacetime and stable conditions were nothing's happening it has a very hierarchical set of rep of reporting relationships when it's going into real time chaos which is what the battlefield is essentially but then the communication structure changes completely it's much more lateral but the hierarchy is a hierarchy of information flow rather than a hierarchy of command it's the role of the hierarchy is to keep everyone informed rather than try to control so we need to think of our organizations in those circumstances where suddenly someone is going to be dumped in chaos well the rest of us are carrying on around them but it's difficult to deal with that kind of variance so the only one is always to also to link risk and response and risk and opportunity as a symmetric pair we never get risk without opportunity we never get opportunity without risk so we need to work with them always as a pair whenever we're looking at the risks of nothing what can we learn for example very real example a lot of organizations had believed before that they could not do work at home well now many organizations have found that yes they can and they can do it very fast indeed switching things in and out to be able to deal with this so we've got to be prepared for a period of not so much total disruption which is what we've had but a period of random little disruptions that are in some ways even more disruptive than the big one so these are the tactics that we can use to start getting prepared for random disruption", "metadata": {"views": 26, "duration": 352.0, "tags": []}}

or normalization and yet when faced with a larger scope issue they're resorting to really shallow very narrow focus short term or else in some cases one particular one in particular came with back with a chunk of standard ideology whenever were pointed out this was unexamined ideology and to examine it because of the scope of change he simply doubled down on the ideology this is just not going to work long term and the scope is actually a scope error and the term for that kind of scope error is bike shedding you'll find it on Wikipedia by the way it's one of their warnings about how to address editing issues on Wikipedia because it comes from a lovely story actually fictional but it's illustrating real world by C Northcote Parkinson but he wrote the book Parkinson's Law he talked about it I commit here which had three agenda items the first was deciding on what to do about a new the build of a nuclear power station the second item was about what color the ancestral structure the bike sheds should be and the third was an eye on a discussion about expenses for refreshments during meeting the nuclear power station they covered in four and a half minutes they discipline did a random decision because it was way outside of their ability to make decisions so they're just simply guessed the bike shed they spent 40 minutes arguing about exactly the bits and pieces and the final item leaks the discussion about the expenses and the refreshments they spent the entirety of the rest of the hour two hours of the meeting arguing about this and since they haven't come to decision deferred that to the next meeting so we've got an inverse scale of attention to the actual severity or seriousness of the problem and what's going on here is that people are answering to their level of understanding if they all understood what a bike shape was and if I had something to say to argue about it almost none of them actually understood the nuclear power station or anything about it and so they just simply skipped over it this is what's happening with many of the issues around coronavirus of we need to have discipline to get past this when we're faced with a major issue we can't just go in four-bike shitty we've actually got to make sure that we're answering at the proper level and that's where our discipline is coming and also where all of the work when fractality comes in because we're able to use the same tools at every scale that's why these tools about that work with context neutral where we and the context to it are so important because we're dealing with things that every possible scale but we need discipline around this the other thing we need to realize is that when the context is changing on us a lot of our previous knowledge a lot of our existing knowledge is actually no not so much no help but an active hindrance particularly when we're dealing with major change now one of the things that is getting to be quite scary in which people are avoiding like crazy there's that difficult as the coronavirus issues are affecting for the same right the way across the scale they're actually quite trivial by comparison with some of what's going on I use a scale of the myth quake scale which is essentially a powers of 10 about the numbers of lives changed in life changes are affected in life changing ways in the case of coronavirus we're talking about tens to hundreds of millions of people's lives being affected which is run the myth quake six to seven the range in powers of 10 but some of the things that we're facing now such as the fundamental fact that we can't have infinite growth on a finite planet and therefore an economics that depends on infinite growth is not viable in the long return that's one of the major issues that's certainly going to a mythical gate affecting billions of people so up to billions of people some of the climate change issues and some of the other issues that we're facing at that sort of scale are right up to extinction level if we don't tackle them now we don't have much time we need to practice on these supposedly hard issues of the corona virus in order to get ready for the much bigger ones that are coming our way we can't afford to hide in bike-sharing it will kill us all", "metadata": {"views": 60, "duration": 388.0, "tags": []}}

"chunk_index": 0, "text": "in the previous video I looked at the whole idea of rights and how they really don't make much sense when we start looking at a major social invisible complex issues such as coronavirus I want to follow on from there as a theme I talked about during there which is that rights are actually implemented by social responsibilities mutual interlocking responsibilities and a lot of the problems arise particularly what we might call a me first culture rights are essentially personal they're about about me that I have these rights whereas responsibilities to make them happen our complex interlocks across a societal rail realm to make that happen it depends also on the culture and a culture that's focused only on the individual will have considerable difficulty in dealing with something that is actually complex associate so we need to find the right balance it's very contextual in different circumstances we want to individuality you're not the circumstances we need people to line up at a fixed idea such as rights that would really doesn't work for that reason really focus instead on the responsibilities not cultural terms what we might think I was Western counters are very much focused on the individual they're about democracy is about individual rights individual focus Western cuts or Eastern cultures tend to be much more we first much more socially if you think of the relationship with the family that occurs in both Japanese and Chinese culture that you get some of the same thing in say South American cultures Latin America is very much a we first but the family level not at the whole society though so you gonna find the right balance for the context that's there and that makes it an issue for enterprise architects so that for example when we look at a me first culture what it risks falling into is what I call a a PDR key rule by for word on behalf of the most childish where we reward people for being childish and punish people for being responsible the danger way that an Eastern Time we first culture is a strong tendency towards groupthink recalling saying that he was asked to give a us a group to bless you I think it was to give an example of from their own experience of something that happened in business and he couldn't get one because in that culture the leader is supposed to be the one who has all the answers and everyone else follows so there were challenges there in both cases there's not the one is right and one is wrong it's about getting the balance right but the issue here is that particularly when we're dealing with something like coronavirus what it was something that requires a social level response about but social distancing tracking tracing all those kinds of things which clash directly with what we might think of as rights but without doing it we're in very real danger so rights often make no sense here we have to focus on the responsibilities and one place that enterprise architects and business are cadets can really look get some the practice in on this to understand what's going on is to look at how this works in most businesses now most organizations are very me first depends on the organization some have a culture that's got a strong we element but particularly in Western business it's very me first very top-down very structured very much but one the most common fails we find is Authority without responsibilities it gives rise to what I call in super ordination with the opposite of insubordination where the leader itself is useless a lot of management issues we get are because it is still very asymmetric that the leader that the subordinates are responsible to the leader but the leader is responsible to no one are certainly not responsible going that way so we need to watch for those kind of inherited balances we want to watch for fails on responsibilities fails on relationships fairs on mutuality she fails on interlocks like the example I gave in another previous video we're a company of what group of directors awarded themselves executives were boarded themselves I think it was four hundred million dollars and then declared the company bankrupt so there are some really serious issues that we need to identify what the drivers are what the supporters for the asymmetries in particular watch for things where someone's bonus sons personal rights to a bonus is actually based on other people's behaviors that often happens with a manager taking credit and little credit in the monetary sense for other people's work there are some very real issues

"chunk_index": 0, "text": "to finish this brief series on introducing change mapping one of the obvious places well how do we use it when do we use it what thing do we use it for the principle is that we actually use it for everything that's particularly applies to the crucial distinctions between architecture and design we want to use it for both we want to use it for exploration we want to use it for exploitation for when we're doing something that we already know how to do because we could still learn from those as well but one of the points about the difference between architecture and design is that architecture always looks upward to the abstract how do things work together better more on purpose design goes down to the real how are we actually going to do it how do we go from the abstract down to the logical structure about how things are going to fit together in general terms then down to the physical structure of the exact software we're going to use and then down to the deployment level the one that we're going to use that operations so every single task works exactly the same way in change mapping we're always going to check context scope do the plan do the action do the review listen let's iterate round so we want to be chaining different approaches for example we do a big picture of should we even be doing this at all the next mission would be what's the basics of how we're going to do it working away from it from enterprise architects we know this is working our way down the Zachman letters going from the most abstract the biggest picture down to the fine detail of action and yet it's still exactly the same they're just different missions that draw on the previous mission were chaining from one to the next we're moving from architecture towards design another one is that word from branching with moving sideways that context may have sepals we can find a number of scopes within a context within a scope we're often going to develop a number of plans a plan many actions coming out of that plan particularly when we're trying to resolve uncertainties that we don't know to shift that unknown unknowns and unknown knowns into known knowns or at least knowable was but we're also doing a lot of nesting the chief mapping structure itself the court context plans a good context spoke plan action review that's rather abstract and it's generically gonna be the same everywhere but we also need to call in context specific things if we're working in finance we're going to be using very different tools but then if we're working in IT or if we're working in HR if we're working in marketing they depend on different models and different tools we'll use in different industries at all we might use or a framework we might use in banking is not the same as with one used in telecoms or in farming so those are context specific tools but they act as plugins we call in those to go down into the detail it's like nesting boxes so there are little mini missions what we don't know something we can fire off a mini mission to say that we now need to find out about this our mission within this larger mission is to find out about something so the same principles that still apply it also helps us to keep on track to purpose and to prevent scope creep so we're using this consistently every scope every scale we're changing from one task to another from one learning level to another from chaining down from from the most big picture down to the operations the results are looping back they're still always following the same change mapping approach we're branching when we're running branches in parallel we're linking them together that's necessary and we nest down to fight the detail that we need so all of this provides a consistent frame for tackling the whole issue from going from architecture through to design through to operations and bareback so when people talk about DevOps for example we're talking about arc DevOps Resort slaughter over the multiple time scales it's still exactly the same approach that's what helps us keep our sanity when the complexity rises beyond the normal levels of that we can bear so change mapping is completely consistent whether we're doing architecture design or whatever it's the detail tools that we call in the change but we're Handel Magnus a consistent way as well the core methods hold them all together is always the same every scope every scale every type of context every type of content every third stage of implementation every time scale that's what we can do in the chain above it

"chunk_index": 0, "text": "something that we're seeing a lot now is people asking what's happening to the future where will the future be when can we get back to normal but there's a real question about what is back to normal what what is normal anyway is it even possible to get back to what we previously had also what does the future mean one of the themes I've seen so often in Enterprise Architecture is a very poor grasp of multiple time scales most people who look at seem to or talk would seem to be talking about the future as being a maximum of two or three years away but when we're dealing with any kind of long term project anywhere military example for example you'll often have things that are expected to have a lifecycle of 20 30 40 years when you're dealing with healthcare by definition you need been dealing with a lifetime of at least a hundred years if you're doing with epidemiology often a longer than that with some aspects of civil engineering you're certainly going to be dealing with at least 50 to 100 years and often in cases went into the century's parts of the london sewerage system left over from roman period 2,000 years ago so we need to be thinking in terms of multiple time scales at the same time so we're talking about futures not just future the future so after we didn't need to add to Enterprise Architecture a lot of the formal disciplines of futures or strategic foresight it's not about prediction like a lot of people seem to be thinking in terms of the idea of as these verses to be we predict the to be it doesn't work that way the only time when the future is known is when it's actually the now it's it when it ceases to be in the future up until then there's always uncertainty so futures is plural not singular it's not to the future but futures that distinction is really important when we start to make sense of where we're going with after coronavirus or even since there's a high likelihood we will be with it now forever what we need is a dynamic adaptation to an emerging future whatever the future emerges we need to be able to adapt to it and adapt our work or organizations our business to it as if we change that way this is where things like scenario planning come in I do here mean scenarios in the much big picture sense not the much more simplistic sense that you'll get in something like TOGAF where scenario is simply the glorified use case what I'm talking about is this scenario at a much larger scale often global but our business has to adapt to that that's the kind of scenarios that we're dealing with now now there are standard ways of looking at scenarios we wanted to build a set of stories effectively about what the nature of the future will be and how we need then from there how we need to react as each one of those options becomes more real so when you add dynamic adaptation to an emerging future we've got the multiple time scales going on so over what periods of time and how things are happening now coronavirus is unquestionably a huge challenge right now it's affecting millions hundreds of millions of people but these still quite trivial challenges compared to what's coming up there's a resource depletion there's climate change doesn't matter whether you what the cause was we know there is climate change happening and all of these are beginning to come more so a lot of the economics assumptions like the whole basis of globalization of hyperglobalisation rather were efficiency or what effectiveness is gained by having something manufactured only in one place in the world and relying on global supply chains to cover the rest may not work when you have no supply check now when you've got breaks in your supply chain hyper localization is not necessarily good because it can be stunningly inefficient very wasteful so how do we find we now need to make that in future terms problematic in other words something that is discussable how do we find the right balance dynamically over longer periods of time and another one which is part of the research have done over the past few decades I cannot see any way in which a possession based economy could be made sustainable it always ends up as being a pyramid game which ultimately can only cannibalize itself into oblivion if we keep on going with the current path we've got as things get tighter we're not going to survive but the point here is that we've got some lead time that is sure about we can't make a possession based economy sustainable we've got a lead time of maybe twenty to thirty years to really start going on it but that means that we need to be starting on it now all of these issues need to be understood now we need to start on them now when it's the best plug good time to plant a tree fifty years ago when we get there it's already too late so we need to be starting to work on these futures now and that means we need to get a better understanding of the futures toolkit and build it into our enterprise architecture practice", "metadata": {"views": 54, "duration": 346.0, "tags": []}}

0, "text": "continuing on with this introduction to change mapping our idea or our aim is to capture ideas insights and information that we can use we want to be able to keep track of where we are hints change mapping building a map of every part of the change now within this each of those domains that we talked about context scope plan action review we're actually collecting and using different types of information that each of those stages that's why in s effort they've got different perspectives on how the whole thing works so in the context what we're looking for all the time is big picture we're looking for vision that holds everything together actually use vision in action when we are completely lost we know what's going on but said to help us keep stable in the midst of deep uncertainty so context helps us collect that information it helps us find values that we're going to use to guide our scope but it's going to find standards laws and so on similar industry standards that were due to use in planning we're going to pick those up because whatever solution you are going to build whatever we're going to work on will need of those standards we'll need those visions so when even if we trim it right down to the smallest one even down to the smallest level we still need access to the information that we got in context now within context we're going to so that's giving us a work in context but always looking upward to the big picture when we get to scope we're partitioning off a small bit of that big picture to work on we're going to do a project on some part but it's always connected back to the context that we started with here we're going to look at things like boundaries we're going to look at things like skills looking at stakeholders we need to identify who does what what the reason is we often describe this as a people area it's because those choices are always made by people whereas the big picture to a large extent is itself we are choosing which bits were going to work on we're choosing the chunk that we're going to act on so it's that's that we've set the and the whole idea is to make sure that we don't wander too far from that scope we know what we're going to do in the plan the next stage down we're going to build instructions we're going to look at the setup we're going to look at the start and end conditions that's the information we want to do we need to do with identify and resolve as many uncertainties as we can before we get into the action colleague described this is kind of bubble metaphor we have to shrink of the bubble in order to get through the skill level determines how big that space is going to be the more skill someone has the more uncertainty they're going to be able to do but a raw trainee or a computer system is not going to be able to deal with much uncertainty at all we've got to resolve any uncertainty during that plan fear period which we will often do by looping through iteratively to resolve as many into the action we also got the start and end conditions one of the common traps is that people know when to start but they don't know when to end particular if there's no obvious end point so any to identify what the signals are that tell us when to start when to end that's what we work on in the plan now in the action we're going to do the actions that are specified in the plan working it but we're also going to have to do sure of information arising because without that information we have nothing to learn from nothing to build nothing to review nothing to reassess that information is absolutely crucial and we need to set up how that information capture is going to be done and what we're going to capture in the plan phase linked back to the scope linked back to the context once the action is over we need to do a review we need to assess whether the benefits realized again benefits realized are going to be a the benefits to realize they're going to be identified in the context the scope and the plan but the benefits realized in the action we're going to need to add to check back against all of those phrases to make sure that we didn't actually do what we claim to do what we intended to do that if there's a variance which is where the lessons third comes in if there's a variance then look at the variance look at what worked well as well as what didn't work well look for all of that information about what we need to change and the distinction here between not just someone needs to change but what will I do personally what will we do as a team personally differently next time what will we commit to learning to do differently next time once so that we're ready for the next time around so that's the information that we're capturing in context scope plan action review regardless of scope scale content or context it's all the ways the same the core principle is always the same in change mapping thanks for watching do

"text": "some Mon ago I did a set of videos about the need for an and method for enterprise architecture that worked essentially the same way everywhere because we cover everything by definition in an enterprise we need a method that does work the same way everywhere that works and every scope and scale every type of content and every type of context that's the actual need we also needed to help us avoid falling into anti patterns of it the classic one of rushing straight into action or rushing straight to a plan without thinking what we're doing and we also need to balance context specific into context neutral the whole point about having something that works in the same way everywhere is that we can keep track of and holds together all the bits that come from all the different spaces that we cover it's not just my team we're covering the business models the operational issues the skills issues the finance operation model everything that we have to cover over interleaving interweaving sets of time and time scales so that's the requirement and what we did with it was developed a method called change mapping which is what I want to look at in this short series of videos now when we look at a task in a Gantt chart actually within the capulet every task is essentially the same it's just a box marked task but what we really want to do is to make sure what happens inside that task is exactly consistent what we need to do is get the right balance between not just doing things right which is often the only focus get an efficient get it exact get it reliable that's the classic focus in most of the issues but what we notice so often it's the issues like scope creep or doing it without actually thinking about what we're doing it for first place so what we need to do is do the right things do them right and also learn from them at every step of the way so that we could learn and adapt dynamically according to changing circumstances what we ended up with was what we called C spa context scope plan passion review and every task is exactly the same for every task no matter how much down the detail level we need to check that we've doing the right context is it the right thing is it on purpose we need to check the scope that we've got the right bit that we're working with and that we're not going to wander off while scope creep go fill into something else completely different unless we intend to do it which we do by iteration we need to make sure that we've got the plan sorted out and that everything is in place for action or as best we can and also that we're doing the action we're capturing the insights the information that we need in order to be able to do a review but then afterwards we do an after-action review of some kind after every single action every task is the same ContiTech the context check the scope work on them if need be get get the plan sorted out do the action in the way that you've specified to make sure you've actually done it do an after-action review every single task the same so we then have what make on a mission wrapper we come in with a question a concern an issue how are we going to do a digital transformation or how are we going to do this sale just something very small to say huge to something very small it's exactly the same so mission X is a kind of wrapper it's actually another C Spire in its own right we've got to do the context what is the context in this question who's going to be working on this question who is going to be doing the exploration on the action how do we make sure this is the right thing and that we've got we get clear about what's going to happen at the end will we check we make sure that we've got benefits real nice and lessons learned after every single action well so who does what one things that we really noticed is that there were rushes into the action but who's keeping track who's the Pathfinder with a guide who's making sure that we stay on track to method that we don't get lost and very often particularly during an exploration when everyone's diving in and exploring who's actually capturing the information that we need the observer who's doing that job so that's what we need inside around every mission making sure that each action that we take is on purpose we know who's doing it who's good what role each person has very much like crew management systems in aircraft each person has a particular role we need to make sure that all the roles we need to covered now all of this has to be iterative it has to be recursive it has to be fractal little mini missions so they're inside missions inside missions which is what we see on a Gantt chart the whole cascade of the tasks within tasks within tasks so that's what we've built and that's what the whole idea of change mapping is about that we always keep track of where we are at all times within any change thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't

"chunk_index": 0, "text": "in the last episode I talked about the very old Chinese model of five elements wood fire earth metal water there's a number of places where we've used that in a very practical way to solve real business problems one of the more interesting ones is called time perspectives each different part of the organization not only have different views onto the organization but often also has completely different views about time and what time scales are what happens this is a real workshop we did with them with a large Bank in fact to get them to understand this the role of strategy and how it fed down into into work and then the continual relearning from that process what we did was we split it up into five fred time frames that matched very well with chinese five elements the first of these are the wood if you like the springing up is all about the future but it's a far future there was fire which is very much about people time people have shift at random from far future too far past and back again it's one of the things that connects all the different time perspectives together and there's planning well the the earth the settling-down we saw a lot of time back scheduling this is about the near future about things that are going to happen quite soon but are not happening now then we've got the metal or stone man what's happening now what's happening now now now always in capital letters always an exclamation mark now but finally there's the kind of review that's settling out that thing's dissolving coming apart looking at the past and all we did was it was an exercise a workshop exercise which you might like to do yourself split up a group into five sub groups you need about 22 five people for this can do it with more but not much less than about 20 for each of these groups one of them is strategy another is HR another is planning or management if you like the kind of scheduling of stuff there's the production people and finally this the review that now the accounts that the follow up the all those kind of areas about you should have right so the strategy people with each of these groups we want them to be to describe each of the other groups and notice how we allow people to be rude and that is what how comes up so for example the strategy people will say well the HR people are crazy but at least they sometimes understand what the hell we're all about the near future yeah they just I think the sort of like us but they just don't have a grasp of how things are working production are bad they don't understand of a future at all they'd only focused on now the past well if they understood how they worked with us they might work but they've got a completely different perspective always looking backward then we cannot say the the HR people who are busy being rude about everyone else we've got the the managers saying that the the the strategy people just idea asked us they've got no idea how things happen in the real world the the HR are crazy but occasionally they give us people that can be useful the the production people they're all again they're all crazy everyone else is crazy because they don't hold the same perspectives as us the trick here is now you to everyone now move round one and notice how what the first thing that comes up and take all so take on the descriptions that they've been given about everyone else and the first thing that comes up is that's really unfair we're just doing our jobs so one of the things that comes up this is a song realization of just how much the different perspectives arise from the nature of the work itself but hence most of these clashes aren't people just being awkward or doing things to be awkward they're trying to do their work as best they can which clashes with us but everyone has to be working together as a whole in order for this to work so one of the things that happens that comes up out of this is first of all what happens if just one group dominates you end up with losing all the other time perspectives and everything that is needed from that and the other thing that happens is finally someone says who's holding the center who's keeping the balance and the answer in too many cases is no one that's why you need someone to do this with us so having got all of this information about the clash isn't natural that there needs to be someone to hold the center to hold the balance that all of these time perspectives are needed to get things right then the next thing we can do is start discussing what we can each do to reduce those clashes and respect that everyone's perspective is correct form their own view even if it isn't so far ours thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to

replaced by another multi-seat cinema but what happens when you've got a service that's sitting there doing nothing an old legacy that is just taking up space to me this is one of the best illustrations of layering and interweaving lintel weaving particularly over time right here we've got the old the current main road coming in past the town this bridge itself is also a main road it's the National Cycle Way route number one the Great North Road down below against the water the roadway there are all the signs of the regiments based in the town Sepideh gash garrison town for over a thousand years think of these in terms of services always an affront is the pub called the hole in the wall the reason why is because it's in a hole in the wall the Roman wall updated in medieval times has been providing the service of protecting the town for all of that period so the pub provides its services - and the Gateway provides control a service of controlled access no longer necessarily required in these days we hope but it's still there so the Gateway is still largely intact after 2000 almost 2000 years we have other services too and litter road signs looking around here there's the gateway the guard way the pub was built in 1650 s behind it we've got the Victorian water tower jumbo which is no longer in use the services no longer required and behind again the Mercury Theatre built in the 1960s still in youssef currently under repair as can be seen through the Gateway and we have signage like in this case looking at the town looking at the history all of these are history but all of these represent services either in use at the time and still often in use now all of these services interweaving layering interconnecting through time and through the present time so that's a real example of how layering and interweaving of services occurs in a large enterprise thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves", "metadata": {"views": 56, "duration": 347.0, "tags": []}}

perspective now remember a myth in this context is an untested or unverified assumption something that we assume to be so and a myth quake occurs whenever we have a conflict between that myth and reality the analogy here is with with an earthquake hence myth quake remember that there are two quite different scales in earthquake models there's the Rita scale which measures the energy on the Macaulay scale which is more about impact there's a friendly given earthquake there's a single level of energy but an infinite range of impacts now for this I'm looking really at a myth quake scale there's more about impact in terms of particularly its impact on lives so a myth quick zero I've got a ten level scale a myth quick zero these are everyday upsets that happen all the time continuously all through the day every time we have a little conflict now that should have worked that didn't work what's wrong that's a very simple first level myth quake a myth quake one is where it starts to have real effects on people's lives so for example every minute of every day around 200 people will meet up with a myth quake around the myth of I gonna live forever and then discover that they don't a myth quake ii particularly is what we relates to what we might call the terrible twos it's particularly around that i am the center of the world the relationship between IE versus other produces all manner of myth quakes then can be quite lethal when they're in a medium scale environment so we can put that up at myth quake ii affecting up to 100 lives miss quakes is the world of work I and what I do when what I do ceases to exist it's like an existential problem if I cease to do the work that I'm was B was doing if I lose my job I no longer exist now this when a company closes this can affect thousands of people that's a myth quake3 a myth quake 4 affecting 10,000 people or more is typical mainstream politics whoever you voted for the government got in and that's the kind of fear where a government policy is going to affect thousands of lives sometimes tens of thousands removing people's ability to live for removing this that and the other happens at a larger scale than a smaller cut than a single company and can affect tens of thousands of lives at a time but in with quake 5 level one of the examples they use here is the whole money system the way that our economics is based on assumptions about how people interact about how some people should trade this can a fairly minor matter can affect a hundred thousand lives an economic crash for example because of failed assumptions about money can easily affect hundreds of thousands of lives at a myth quake six level it's more about what people believe to be true we see things like meaning about religion about beliefs about science beliefs there are larger scope than just politics but Rx again existential assumptions which when challenged can affect literally millions of lives the next level up we're talking about the whole I am Who I am and particularly when someone else decides that you should not be or should not exist because of what you are things that of which you have no choice at all such as race gender sexual orientation ethnic group so both social class of birth all of these things of which you have no control these kind of easily affect tens upon tens of millions of lives particularly when we see things like a religious war break out or when we get race racial attacks on a particular group the next one is myth quake eight we're up in the tens of millions of lives range here is ideas that are fundamental but actually don't work now one of them for me is the concept of rights rights are a kind of assumption that it's often not so much about rights but about the evasion of responsibility and causes things to fail that this can be up in huge levels particularly when we start looking at our responsibilities in relation to the world in which we live and for me a myth quake 9 which is running right up against extinction levels kind of what kind of levels of worry oh the whole myth around the idea of possession that I possess that it's all about me so that's a scale we can use to measure and identify the types of interactions that occur the types of risks that are involved and also why this is so darned important because practicing on the small earthquakes allows us to work on the big ones from an enterprise architecture perspective this scale we mostly deal with in enterprise architecture we mostly deal with issues that are at most around myth quake for around the world of work in the world of politics but some are heading right up into myth quake seven with the whole issues around diversity and the social media that were the whole social media in which we live is heading very fast towards some very real myth quake 9 level myth quakes we need to deal with faced with these we need to start tackling them and we need the tools to do it that's why this is important you",

0, "text": "in this set of videos we're looking at a tool called the holomap whose job it is to help us map out who the stakeholders are in an enterprise and what our relationships are with with each of them the first video in this set we looked at the the content of an enterprise in this case the ten videos that take conferences of ideas worth spreading well one of the things the actions the locations the people the events and the decisions are within that overall enterprise kind of summary or overview in the next video we've started mapping them out in terms of who are these people in each case there is someone who's dealing with the things someone who's doing actions someone who's doing the location in managing the hutt locations someone who's dealing with particular events and so on so who are all these people who are they that's what we needed to get a big picture or the context of the overall enterprise so in this video we'll take that the next step on and start looking at what are the responsibilities and relationships with the with each of the players where we position ourselves within that enterprise now in this case we talked about that we were we were a social media provider so for each of those players what is our relationship with them what are the receipt of things responsibility accountability consulted informed and what is their distance from us how much are they direct interactions do we transact with them and so on this is where the holomap really comes that comes in as a different distinct tool because we described it in terms of three quite distinct layers the first layer we look at who are our suppliers the transactions who are our suppliers who are our customers directly from that set of print promotional material customer service and so on so our customers often will have a kind of indirect step which is customers customer and supplier supplier so a lot of our stuff is two-stage because the definition of customer for social media is both the person using the social media but also the person monitoring it and often the person who actually pays us is not the person who's using the social media but the person who's monitoring it so the relationships are different in fact we don't really have a direct connection often with our individual people other than if we're supporting customer service so the individual users of social media we don't necessarily provide they are actually providers to us beyond that the next day so that's transactions beyond that what we might call direct interaction these are people that we need or that we interact with but not really as part of our main value stream they're people like the educate the the trainers recruiters how are we going to find people to run our social media operation who are going to train the people up in the particular tasks that we need to be done there's regulators are various kinds there are journalists who we need to help us work with the social media area this technology supplier cells technology suppliers down here somewhere take a provider hosting providers all that and we also have competitors we've got to think of as being out in that space so we're getting the site and an idea of what our relationships are the distance they are further out there are things like families there's things like holidays vacations what happens if a family member is ill what happens if there is a problem generally around so these are indirect in direct transactions that can affect us a lot and this is areas like for example it includes things like government what are the rules that we have to operate under not just specific to our industry but more generally things like tax things like planning law and so on that about how our operation can work we've also got this issue I mentioned before about anti clients people who disagree fundamentally with what it is that we're doing now these are extremely important in social media one of our jobs is to track them identify who they are so this is although they are a distant relationship this is extremely important because we usually identify an anti client through social media someone who's strongly disagreeing with how the how the business our business operates or have the business that we are supporting in social media will operate also to consider are any investors and any beneficiaries not necessarily the same people so as we've mapped this out what we now want to do is what are the responsibilities for each what is each of these people responsible for in terms of the overall story and in terms of what we need to do so a regulator is responsible for regulating our industry we have to follow the standards so that's another one we need to look at is standards bodies what are the standards that apply to our industry so we are mapping out what each of these relationships will involve who's responsible for what who's accountable for what what part do they play in the overall story in this case of ideas worth spreading we're just doing the social media bit others are doing other parts of it what are our relationships with each of these players that we've identified previously as being part of the overall story the purpose of all of this is not just to look at what who they are but each one of these in applies a project a process or a service each one of these says that there is going to be some kind of interaction going on some kind of direct transaction some interaction some more distant interaction what are the responsibilities of each of the players here that's what we do when we're plotting up the scope or using holomap to plot out the scope of what we're going to do for a project or a plan thanks for watching do look at the youtube description for links to further detail

{"id": "C-gUZHsesm8_0", "video_id": "C-gUZHsesm8", "title": "Mythquakes and cognitive dissonance: Episode 95, Tetradian on Architectures", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-gUZHsesm8", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "following on from yesterday's video about myth quakes introducing the idea of a myth quake someone asked isn't myth quick just cognitive dissonance what's different well the short answer is yes sort of but the selection a lot more to it so cognitive dissonance yes it's one source common source of myth quakes but there are others and the most obvious one is actually not so much cognitive dissonance as the absence of any cognition at all following habit rather than actually thinking about something so a myth quick arises when with an assumption collides with reality a misplaced assumption so cognitive dissonance itself is only about the fact or the mechanism of a mismatch it doesn't really tell us anything more than that whereas myth quick focuses more on the consequences of the mismatch rather than just the fact of mismatch so a guiding criterion were using for impact is that it's got life-changing effects that it literally changes someone's life that's when a myth great becomes significant there are masses upon masses of little myth quakes right the way through the day but little things that don't match up but the ones that we think are significant up to the level of a quake rather than turn a tremor are the ones that have some kind of life-changing impact and we've then got a measurement scale that goes in powers of ten so it's an exponential scale so ten to the zero means only one person's life is changed ten to the one or myth quake one level is that can be up to ten people's lives being changed here by the time we get to so we can easily get something that's a thousand tens of thousands millions tens of millions right up into the billions level until we get to a myth quake in nine and somewhat which is actually an extinction level event which we have a few of those on the horizon so just sayin cognitive dissonance doesn't tell us anything about this extra material about the actual the impact of that cognitive dissonance also it could be in a sense it also helps to us to identify that something because cognitive dissonance merely tells us that the thinking is wrong not what they want what to do about that wrong thinking and miss Blake also adds a whole systematic structure for what to do before during and after a mythical way before we want to focus on identifying the possibility for a myth quake mitigating any possible myth quake and also building preparedness of when any myth quake might occur during them the myth quake we've got structures that are about keeping panic at bay but providing guiding principles and so on dealing with triage and after we've got to focus on recovery are also going to focus on learning so if we just say it's the same as cognitive dissonance all of that is missing but also a much simpler one if we look at just the terms cognitive dissonance versus myth quake cognitive dissonance is a tangled term it isn't even about sound anyway so dissonance isn't even correct it's it's kind of technical some even might describe it as elitist it's six syllables long it's a tangle to say whereas myth quake rolls off the tongue in the same way that mistake does in fact there are some comparisons there but also myth quake as a term it's immediately identifiable it's descriptive there is a quake there was a myth involved and there's a quaint going on but it's going to direct and actually quite accurate analogy with earthquakes the buildup of tension and so on and the way that tension can be build up the more and more we ignore the stresses that are driving that that potential myth quake the other thing we can do here is we can use that thing as an example as a worked example of myth quake itself so there's an assumption right here in the statement isn't it just cognitive dissonance well it's an assumption it's an honor it's unexamined it's untested it's unverified in that sense it's a myth we have no way of sight knowing beforehand whether it's true but when we would collide with a reality Department right here in a very simple way where I've explained there's much more to myth quake than just cognitive dissonance then that's the actual impact so it means that we have not just a myth but a myth quake it's collided with reality demand there are consequences to that collision the consequence here is probably not life-changing for anyone maybe I don't know but it shows us that there are possibilities here that all options that are just being missed that are not available to us if we just say arbitrary label it as cognitive dissonance because it doesn't give us any guidance as to what to do about that cognitive dissonance the fact of not having access to those means to change something means that them a tiny myth quake could well become a much bigger myth quake with greater and greater impact so when we look at this in terms of the recovery from this particular myth quake discovering that is isn't myth quick just cognitive dissonance is actually an incorrect assumption what do we do to recover from this well the most important one is don't jump too quickly to assumptions and particularly don't jump to jump to obvious comparisons when you haven't actually looked in any depth of what's going on now that applies not just to with quake itself but for example to most of what's called currently called Enterprise Architecture my main field there's a cotton a huge myth quake around the idea that it's only about IT instead we need to realize that it's about the whole and the assumption that it's only about IT has very serious consequences for what we can and can't access and work on during that event of working on an enterprise architecture likewise right now I'm stuck in a hotel having had the mismatch of the myth that I could arrive in Australia at any time and discovering that actually no I can't so no it's not just cognitive dissonance there's more to it than that", "metadata": {"views": 29, "duration": 406.0,

"chunk_index": 0, "text": "something I've been working on for a long time now is a concept I describe as myth quake we depend a lot on assumptions and when those assumptions are on unexamined untested or unverified it's what we might call a myth now when that kind of myth collides with reality Department what we get is what we might call a myth quake yes there's a straight analogy there with an earthquake list attention built up that when it releases there's a kind of explosion now in earthquakes we have to pretty much exponential scales one of which is Richter which most people know which is a measure of the energy of an earthquake but in principle there's only one given Richter measure for any given earthquake and the Mercalli scale which is a measure of impact and by definition we have an almost infinite number of mccally references for any given earthquake so in a myth quake we can measure in terms of the scale of impact in terms of the number of people who undergo or faced with life changing in events from the respective myth quake we can put it in powers of 10 where 10 to the 0 is one person affected in a life-changing way all the way up to ten to the nine point seven which we might consider to be an extinction level event an extinction level myth quake some people suggested I ought to name this scale after my selves call it a grave scale but unfortunately it's a bit too literal so let's just call it mq scale a myth quake scale no earthquakes can be positive to for example a wedding getting married is a myth quake the assumption that I am alone is no longer true there are all sorts of things that are changing having a child born is a myth quake and its own changes a lot of our assumptions in a very real way so this can be very positive as well but it's in this case I'm looking at it particularly in terms of the life changing is more of a challenge particularly because when we refuse to look at the potential for a myth quake the tension increases so that quite often politics can affect a thousand lives ten thousand lives that puts us in the range straightaway of myth quake four to five but when we start mixing things like gender into it or race issues which most people are trying to avoid or ignore then the potential can easily rise to the point where it affects millions tens of millions even hundreds of millions of people that puts us right up in a myth quakes terminal rate which by the fact of ignoring it means that we've ended up with a much greater myth quake than we previously would have done so there are very real risks that arise from denying or refusing to face the potential for a myth quake a very real example which we're dealing with right now is about all the myths about just-in-time logistics and globalized supply chains everything's fine as long as everything can move unchallenged easily across the world when suddenly that isn't the case a lot of our supply chains are breaking down which itself exacerbates the risk because it's now affecting millions of people and tens of millions of people rather than just being a local event so myth quakes we need to do us a whole bunch of things we need to look at myth quick risk and opportunity we need to identify what those are because even with each one of those from an architecture perspective there will be elements of that that are relatively predictable including often the probability of the myth quake itself we can certainly see how elements of a myth might be exacerbated by people refusing to look at it and thus increase the risk that's involved another one is to be prepared for myth quakes we've got to be ready for them practice them even in small things just everyday upsets like in my case being stuck in a hotel room for 14 days because of quarantine rules how do I adapt to that well get by getting ready on the small things with the same methods apply in the large ones we're looking at risk mitigation the the myth quick mitigation and also adaptation when it gets more extreme which is risk reduction but as I say adaptation means for changing four things which the which we cannot reduce the risk there's also a myth point recovery where we need to be looking at how we're dealing with and how we resolve the disruption that a myth quake will cause even at the small scale all the way through to the large ones one of the ways we do that is by particularly by focusing on what the opportunities are for constructive change arising from that myth quake and also admit quick response in real time how we handle the myth quake at the time so that's things like triage which I'm doing right now with things like escrow and so on working out what I can do in a hurry or what are the most urgent sequence of things that I do in case I no longer be able to work and also things like guidance principles what are the choices for example how does this how does this action help everyone rather than only help me so these are things that a myth

"text": "in the past two videos we've been looking at the whole idea of simple yet not simplistic about how to build a method that supports that actual idea using the whole principles on itself so in this video we'll look at some of the things that we actually did to make this happen looking at all the different metaphors the different assumptions the challenges that we had to face to make it all work the challenge that we faced when trying to build an EI method that would cover the full scope and scale was to find a way to simplify the very real complexity that covers the whole of that space let's take a look at some of the dimensions of that complexity the first one is fairly straightforward that we have one thing that follows another nothing complicated there step by step but we then want to find going diving down into the detail so if we think of that as step by step then these dive down into deeper and deeper levels of detail and we're also running many things in parallel so straight away we've got three dimensions that are all clashing with each other so for example each of these has its own step by step and is often running things in parallel as well and each of those have their own detail so you can see the complexity builds very fast indeed to add to the complexity on top of that something that we find here in this place might well cause us to redesign or rethink what we were doing back over here so if you think of that as being the step by step the-- the sequence the chain the links that's the parallel that's the detail these are links from any point to any point and that may cause us to go back and rethink so this builds and all the time we have to find a way to store the information so that we can get at it again and also insights can appear completely at random so right down in the detail somewhere here is insight light bulb we that may not be relevant even to the task that we're doing but may well be important elsewhere so that was the challenge we faced so the first way the place we started was a very classic very old model slightly reworked she's the the old group dynamics or forming storming norming sequence also the Chinese five elements sequence which we framed as purpose people preparation process and performance all rotating around kind of pivot that was our starting point but we needed to make it human we needed to make it accessible we needed to handle all of this complexity all in one go so to make it more human the first thing we did was to literally make it human we built it as a kind of a series of rooms around a central atrium each of these being for example similar to the way that strategy people work the way that people people work the preparation the planning of something the actual doing of the work the process then following through one what did we do what did we learn always we're looking for this basic principle of what's the big picture what are the boundaries what's the plan of the preparation what are we actually doing what are we capturing right now what have we learned from this how well did we do in terms of the original purpose but we soon found that while that handles the step-by-step aspects and the continuation of the linking of things it didn't handle parallel and it didn't handle detail so we tried another way so the next metaphor was to emphasize again the people part of this and to focus on how information flowed back and forth how we kept returning to this central atrium as the place where we stored the information and so that we could possibly go back if we need to it isn't just a fixed step-by-step but we found that that didn't handle the problem of parallel or detail either it made it more human it made it more accessible but it still didn't actually solve the problem in the next attempt we focused on the the act the storing of information so that we had this idea of the pathway where there was a loop to it but we store the information at the end of each phase and each phase is quite distinct but again that gives us the idea of the step by step looping which it often does but it still doesn't tackle the parallel it does tackle the the the storing of information but it doesn't tackle the detail nor this building level of complexity so next one we focused on making the sorry that the previous one was rather clumsy with with the emphasis too much on the storing of information so we say I had used the idea of folders where collecting information and storing it in folders and again making it human by putting people in the space by making it human but emphasizing much more clearly what's going on we now dropped the idea of a loop because what it was is just a pattern and the pattern may appear in each place in each way it's still just the same pattern a loop is a particular type of step-by-step relationship but it isn't the only one in another face we emphasize the folders even more and what happens inside the folders but a side-effect of that was we actually dropped it being less made it less human we found that all the attempts to make it human actually got in the way so we still kept the person in there making it real and focusing much more around the actual tasks and concerns being done but we tackled the complexity by in a sense not tackling it but by building the complexity in the way it in related rather than try to put it into the pattern itself in the form that's in the final book this is essentially just the same idea we've accepted that we can't actually include all of the complexity but by focusing on the pattern and keeping the pattern consistent every time we end up with something that is still absolutely consistent every scope every scale type of content any type of context web defy identifying these we start a mission which is essentially one of these package to down we start we start with a gun issue we identify who's going to do it why we're doing it what the actual question is and what we're going to do with it we then use the structure this standard pattern what's the big picture what's the boundaries who's involved who's making those choices what is the plan the preparation for any given task what's the action for given any any given task what's the review for any given task so these if it often become just little more than checks worse these are the ones we do all the time at the end of a folder we're reviewing the whole thing which is giving us the answer and we tackle the complexity by in a sense removing it and yet still leaving all the hooks in place to handle all the types of complexity that may arise that's what's in the book that's what we've settled on as being the best approach that we could do to keep it simple in the midst of enormous complexity so that's the basic change mapping method or approach what's the issue let's start a mission within this we have any number of what's the context what's the scope enormous numbers of plan action review plan action review plan action review with an ending to do the review of the whole and returning the answer that we need thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail

0, "text": "in a previous video we introduced a frame called scan which gives us a very simple way to help make sense of complexity it's essentially just two axes one of them is the amount of time before and after a given now and an axis of certainty versus uncertainty predictability versus unpredictability sameness versus difference uniqueness and as before what we've mentioned was that you can actually divide this into something like a four quadrant model which is on the ones hand there's a transition from if we do the same thing we'll get the same results so if we do something different we may get the same results or if we do the same thing we may get something different so on this side it's very much rule-based on this side it's very much skill based now that can move around a lot and also there's a transition between the time we have to think about it versus the higher time we have to do something yeah at the moment of commitment towards action where we have to decide so we talked before about the kind of methods we use the algorithms up here we're using algorithms and calculation down here we really don't have time but to follow the rules we need work instructions at this place it's about the rule following the rules that will give us the results of certainty up here we've got heuristics and patterns whereas down in this area where we're dealing with real time deep uncertainty especially over here we're going to need principles to guide us principles and values we can also describe this though in terms of skill level classically these would be the trainee the apprentice what we might call the entrance to the trade where you start being able to deal with the real uncertainties classically you call this person a journeyman and finally you have a master a masters job is to deal with any kind of uncertainty in real time in accordance with what we're trying to do now in a previous video we've talked about some of the transitions that apply here and in an other videos we've talked about the different modes of thinking that are necessary to make this work so a trainee tends to be very much a believer they have to do what they're told and really nothing else the apprentice starts to learn what's going on the danger with an apprentice is that they start to believe that they know the rules and can control the rules by rich real work is done but they actually have no real experience of dealing with uncertainty over here the danger with the apprentice and we see this so often in different trades is that they have just enough trouble and just just enough skill to get into trouble just enough knowledge and nothing like enough knowledge to get out of trouble again so the trainee is always deeply supervised and it has to follow the rules the apprentice is learning what the rules are and the factors that control them but they need deep supervision and very often should not be let loose anywhere near anything a journeyman should be able to deal with the uncertainties but will need supervision and then the to prove that they have gone past the journeyman phase they will do what's known as a master piece literally to prove that they have the skill levels of a master that they can deal with the uncertainties of the real world the master's job is to deal with those uncertainties so there's a path that happens here a very clear development path from trainee to apprentice to journeyman and then on to the master now one of the practical problems is that the master can't explain what they're doing they can't derive that don't have time to derive in real time an explanation of what they're doing they're often winging it on the basis of principles so they're not good people to explain to apprentices what's going on that's what the journeyman's job is is to get the next level of apprentice so your organization needs this transition but to do it you also need remember what this bounder is time to think versus no time to think now notice what happens if we don't allow people time to think we end up with a system that consists solely of trainees and masters and no way that a trainee can actually develop into becoming a master what happens in a lot of organizations is that when there's a huge pressure to produce produce produce or when no one is allowing time for people to go through that path you end up with an organization that when it loses the people who started it off there's no way to keep it going an organization that does not allow time to reflect time to develop will destroy itself in the longer term these are the kind of things that scan can help us identify what kinds of skills we need what kind of methods we're going to use in each case the skill level we need for different types of concerns between truth on one side which are putting quotes in other words what is supposed to be the rules versus value or usefulness certain this needs certainty but can't deal with the uncertainties of the real world so there is a development path going here so scan is helping us to identify which of these are applying at each given circumstance and how we build the skill levels and what we need to build the skill levels to help people become the masters that we need to deal with the uncertainties of the real world thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links

"text": "in a previous video we introduced the framework called scan which is a very simple way to make sense help us make sense of complexity it's just two axes relative to our given now how much time we have before and after and also the extent to which it's certain or uncertain predictable or unpredictable same or unique and we've in that previous videos or in previous videos we've talked about a real boundary which we might call the inverse Einstein boundary about if we do the same thing we'll get the same result if we do different things we will get we can get the same result if we do the same things we can get the same result if we do the same things we may get different results or we may need to do different things to get the same effective result I did the other axis what we have is a transition point between decision between the time to make sense versus the time we've got to decide between time to think and no time to think so we can give these although we've used labels before of calculated or complicated simple or rule-based ambiguous or pattern based and not known nothing's the same we have no time to think about it and it's inherently uncertain we can give these labels or descriptors kind of rolls if you like so on the one side this one we have to do things on belief we don't have time for anything else so this is the believer it's a roll it's not a person it's a roll here we can talk about the scientist someone who is calculating what's going on but probably doesn't reach the real world very much it's not dealing with real time on the other side dealing with uncertainty we've got the technologist the engineer the phrase it depends comes to mind what's down here we have the artist and there's a nice analogy here where we can describe reality as being like a swamp the artist runs like heck the catch is that you can't really come back you get lots of experiences but you can't really come back you can't describe how you got there the believer stays in exactly one place and follows the rules these are the answers that are previously set we will do what we know that gets us results fast but it can't deal with variation or variance or another what we have is the scientists who've been very clever they've woven a platform they've woven up a platform between these individuals of belief to build a whole structure and finally we have the technologists who can was like spreading of their weight on swamp shoes they can travel around and rest for a while so that they don't sink so the driver here is effectively truth versus value between each of these there are edges so this one we might describe as the edge of innovation an artist comes up with an idea and bat it bounces backwards and forwards between experiment new idea experiment new idea but we're always dealing with the uncertain we can't really produce things very much so that's the edge of innovation this one is the edge of uncertainty where again we bounce backwards and forwards the job of those two is to reduce uncertainty is to identify what has to remain complex and will always remain uncertainty versus things that extract out of it the things that can be made more certain so that's an edge of uncertainty here we have more bouncing backwards and forth back and forth across the edge of action and here is what we might call the edge of panic where the believer gets launched into they're not known now there's an interesting thing that happens here because if we look at how this works in real life we have if you look at how science develops we have idea the new idea arises in the not known the only place where new ideas can arrive and can arise is from the not known from there we build a hypothesis we then test that refine that to build a theory and from there we derive what we think of as scientific law or some kind of law so there's a very strong loop or strong a strong link that goes from there to there the flow is in this direction but there's a catch if we think of it as a development loop it should go back to new ideas again but instead what we often have is what we might describe as the heresy barrier the fear of difference the fear of change and we build a solid wall against any air for seeing anything new this is the heresy barrier and in every organization every context wherever there's a rule that is being followed and is treated as a ver truth we will have problems with a heresy barrier so one of our tasks in making sense of complexity and uncertainty in dealing with all of these transitions is to face that barrier otherwise we will never be able to get any innovation working at all so there's a nice way of describing ways of looking at and the kinds of thinking the modes of thinking that we need how we transition between them but also to be aware of getting stuck in any one of these positions and particularly that one of the heresy barrier so scan is really useful for helping us make sense of these kind of transitions the the changes in modes of thinking that we need to make something happen it's a very useful tool for this kind of purpose thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description

"in this video I wanted to look at a core aspect of context for any organization which is its visioning its vision now if you're familiar with business motivation model this is you'll notice in a moment that this is quite significantly different what business motivation model calls her vision is actually what we would call a goal it's about how the organization of the organization's view of itself what we've got here is that there is a vision a story that holds the whole enterprise together the organization positions itself in relationship to that overall story the vision for the enterprise it then has a decisions about how it's going to play that role it has its own goals in relation to how it does its mission it looks at the outcomes to assess them to assess the goals to assess how well it's doing in its mission and it has tasks that it's then assessing their outcomes so we're going to be looking at the visioning part they're much larger scope of this now behind this is a concept of the enterprise now we've got a fundamental difference going on here between the organization and the other shared enterprise the enterprise is in essence a story and that's what the visioning or the vision is the organization places itself into the market it has a role within the market so it has a role it has its own choices its own mission about how it's going to play that role it has its own goals in relation to how it's going to play that role so vision role mission goal so to understand mission to understand vision we need to understand what the enterprise is what the story is that holds everyone together the thing that links everyone together within this overall story so we come down to a kind of three part phrase in fact a vision statement you see vision statements that can be half a page long a vision statement that really works is really only about three words it should never be longer than about five to ten words at most what we have is we always have a focus or concern everyone is concerned everyone the whole story is concerned about something now the example I'll use here is the Ted videos that the company Technology Entertainment Design that it's they talk about ideas worth spreading so the focus is ideas what is everyone doing about those ideas well one everyone is doing it that Enterprise is spreading ideas and the driver is about well why is this important well the as far as Ted is concerned these are ideas that are worth spreading so if we take that into the the Ted statement its ideas worth spreading and everyone in the whole story is concerned with ideas that are worth now what that tells you from there is that the organization's must be dealing with something to do with that it must have a role an in Ted's case it's about conferences videos and more books for example other people play other roles for example there are the people who do the TED talks they have a different role within that overall story the people who create the ideas the people who are implement those ideas all have different roles within that story but everyone is concerned with the one story of ideas worth spreading it also tells us what the values are so that if we look at that the role is about spreading ideas but the values that drive this relate to worth this gives us our values it also gives us our success criteria one of the values aren't worth well how do we assess what is an idea that is worth spreading we're going to assess things like before during and after how do we assess what is an idea that's worth spreading how do we assess the value of the actual presentation of that idea and later on outside the scope of the organization itself because that's only doing conferences videos and books someone's going to assess whether that idea was worth spreading how was it used how was it applied how did it make sense how could we use it how can we learn from what was done before so all of this arises from that three word statement ideas worth spreading everything that we do within the organization is then tested by not just ourselves that's our mission and our goal but about how everyone in that enterprise sees how we are doing our goal so visioning is really crucially important to make sense of how our organization relates with the enterprise and we can build it out of just three words what is our focus what is the action that where everyone is doing what is the driver that makes it worthwhile the action tells us what our role will be or gives us a range for what our role can be the driver tells us what the values are and success criteria that the enterprise expects from us and to which every promise that we make must align so that's visioning it's really central to making sense of the context for any given organization thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrO9QZhrn1E", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "in the previous video on scan we looked at how the whole thing works how all the different parts work together how it's built from really a very simple relationship between time and complexity or uncertainty what I want to do this time is to simplify it right down to just those two elements the time before before and after something happens and the level of uncertainty and what we can do about that uncertainty so this one's based on a fairly straightforward example of an operation a surgical operation imagine someone's going for an operation known on a cancer let's say so it's a slightly concerning issue but let's have a look at how all the elements in that stack together so if we draw that simple axis from of time coming through to and now and then onwards into what will become after who will become the after so we're going from before to the now and then the after and in the opposite direction we've got a scale of uncertainty or complexity all the way out to complete uncertainty we have no idea what's going on so from certain to uncertain I will start up here with the very beginning point of the of the whole thing which is if this is if the now is going to be the moment of being within the operation itself then here is when the patient first comes in and the first thing we want to capture is patient identity and that's important because everything else comes from that you don't want to do the operation on the wrong person you don't want to do the wrong operation on that person you've got to pin everything onto that so that's really an absolutely core item we've got to be certain about that now as time goes on just after straight after we've brought that person into the hospital the next thing we want to check is patient condition and we note that that's going to be changing all the way through we're going to be concerned about that that's likely to go to being more or less certain over time and we're also going to have to be concerned about what the family are doing we're going to although the patient is the person were working on there are other stakeholders in this case there's a family and we need to watch that that's not something we can control at all and what for that we're definitely going to need someone like say a chaplain to help us keep track of what's going on whereas something for the patient identity the first thing we're likely to do is print a barcode bracelet good clip that on in a way that it's not going to come off then having got that sorted out we want to pin down a theater booking we want to have the the operating theater booked that's another crucial thing because we need to know where it's going to happen if you like that's who this is where and this is related to what this is a issue that we want to be able to bring more say it more certain than it is at the moment next thing on this if we've got the theater booking and the patient condition tracked we now want to find out what to develop a surgery plan and that's going to be contending on the patient condition there's a dependent relationship here as also yeah given the surgery plan we're now going to need an equipment plan that too is a dependency and we need to be very clear about those we can't go into the theater if we haven't got the right equipment otherwise we're going to be putting the patient at risk so we need to be certain about this we know these are uncertain we know that we don't have a clue what's going to happen here because one of the things that's liked it happen is we're likely to get pre operation complications and again we really want to be able to pull those over as much as we can to make those more sense more certain but we know that we can't know beforehand we also got to check the surgical staff availability who's going to be available to do it because that can vary we've got rosters but it's a known unknown as we get closer towards doing the operation of the day of them the morning of the operation we're going to double verify the patient's identity we've got the patient on the gurney we now need to verify that this is the verify the patient it's the right one and we've verified not just the patient identity and action so if it moves an operation on a leg we might literally draw on that leg and action this must be known before we go into the into the surgery and the next thing we're going to need to verify usually with the checklist is the consumables that we're going to use we're going to need the right consumables with a margin for error like blood packs and so on because what we don't want to have happen is though suddenly going uncertain on us we need to keep track of what's going on now another booby trap that can happen at the very last moment we've got the patient ready we've got the prescient under anaesthetic and then suddenly we've got a traffic emergency and everything well it's all hands down to go and do an emergency so every theater gets booked in a hurry [Music] and we have to boot our patient out of the theater because someone else has an even higher priority that our patient does now that's another known unknown we know it's a risk we need a protocol in place to handle it so it's we need to be clear what the safe last moment is before we can actually go into theater on when we close the theater and say you can't come in so along with that there's all kinds of emergency actions that might be needed as we go into the operation itself things can go wrong and we don't know beforehand what they're going to be a surgeon might Nick Nick the patient's aorta while trying to cut out a liver cancer for example that means you've got very serious emergency action we also might have the family trying to barge in at the last moment having realized it's a life-threatening injury a life-threatening operation and therefore we're going to need not so much a chaplain here we're going to need security staff to stop them barging in and as we go through the now of the operation one thing that we're going to be building up all the time is action records because we're going to need those to learn form from the future so what we're doing is we're trying to move things around trying to make things more certain build things that will help us anchor certainty in some way or another but we can also see an important point here about we can divide this quite simply not just in terms of certainty but the tools we can use for certainty hence for example here we want IT this is very much something that we want IT to do the IT is going to be taking effectively doing the decision making they're very simple decisions in most cases about identity but they're essential decisions here we have protocols that deal with uncertainty and the role of IT is IT decision support not decision-making and over here this is going to depend entirely on human skill and the only role of IT is going to be real tight IT provides real-time info and that's it so this is a simple example of how to plot something out using those two axes it's a simple example of scan about the choices that we make that the kinds of tools that we can use and build for these kinds of purposes how we make all of this work dealing with uncertainty accepting uncertainty is an inherent fact of the context rather than pretending that everything can be locked into IT so we look at those again the quick summary a quick overview is that we've divided we mapped out in time and in terms of uncertainty to help us build an understanding of what's going on and we can partition it in terms of the tools that we can use of the kinds of decision-making that has to be done that's a useful role

"text": "what are the stages of service delivery what's the service cycle a complete cycle of a transaction we've got this simple pattern here to explore help us explore what happens in services and service delivery it's actually the same kind of pattern is in the five element sequence that we're seeing elsewhere but it's there's more detail here more subsections within the completions phase so here's the overall pattern each step of the pan is supported by distinct services marketing sales delivery accounts customer service and so on the first step is that we look at shared purpose we establish a common enterprise a common story that context the kind of shared reason to connection interact with each other at all the next one is the week start to make a connection often a personal connection but we also narrow it down to a scope for action and the beginnings of some kind of policies around which any kind of transaction will be built the kind of personal questions of who are you do we trust each other enough to proceed actually applies to both human and machine alike the next step is we agree on a plan for action we built up a conversation but also a contract this settles the details of what will be exchanged in each duration information services products payments whatever we're then set up the transaction itself but this is going to be the content for the transaction or interaction and that depends on all of the previous stages it's really important that we don't over focus on this stage we then actually do the prod delivery of product or service now this is what we would map out in the fine detail of conventional process modeling but notice that it's always in context with everything that's happened before we now come to the completions and each one of these wraps back and matches back to the previous step so several sub stages here which the first is just simply to to ensure that there's an actual end to an endpoint to the delivery of the service or product we're now complete for the for the perspective of the provider we complete the contract in a commercial context typically a failure occurs when the customer or consumer pays four pays for the service pays the supplier or the provider the next step is that we complete from the other side of the story we're completing the relationship making sure that the relationship is sorted out again the completion here make often occur sometime after the completion of the action itself for example bought food is eaten and finally we can complete from the perspective of the story the shared purpose the enterprise for long term viability all of these interactions must be seen as fair and balanced not just by the trans actors but by all of the players in that shared space so so far this has been a little bit abstract so let's make it come alive and we add the human dimension with some simple minifigures so a simple transaction example we've got a service provider on one side a service consumer on the other first part of this is we establishing an initial connection typically this is done by reputation or brand but we build a connection that's about the broader story the promises that we each make to the story itself we then establish a kind of personal connection which also provides basis for the rules and for the interaction we're also narrowing down word from the big picture to ace more specific scope for action we then start working on something like a contract we specify and agree the details of what the agreement will be about what's going to happen and we often typically do this with a literal handshake we're now set up do the setup for the transaction itself we take action to make the agreed plan happen and we then get the transaction to happen but notice that the people who do the work who actually deliver it the actors which are maybe human or machine in this case humans the ones who do the actual work may not be the ones who had specified the interaction we're then going to establish that the work is complete we've completed the terms of the contract typically we're going to now involve someone like an Accounts Department to deliver the services for the support services for interrupt for completion and notice too that the completion is made it different for each of the players so example here the customers got to satisfy their customer the customers customer and it's always about the whole enterprise the kind of the satisfying those that support the whole story it's always about the overall shared story not just the promises made to each other but tying to the story itself and every stakeholder is watching every stakeholder in that story there's a previous mood video we talked about the holomap about how to identify the full set of stakeholders this really matters here now a really important warning don't try to shortcut that sequence or cycle there's a very common broken version of the cycle which we call the prick quick profit cycle you grab a contract you transact you completely brother next contract you transact your complete and you lose the purpose the connection with people the connection to the story you lose the connection to values to trust to policies it all falls apart all of a sudden without any apparent warning so here's the quick profit trap literally we go from to contract to transaction to doing it to completing to satisfy getting satisfied from the providers perspective owner only and ignore everyone else now this looks like it gets better results in the short term by focusing only on our needs but doing so we greatly risk long-term Roberti so if we focus only on self and on ignoring others in comes out comes we will awaken at very angry regulators we will get hit quite hard or apparently without warning and remember all of this is in full view of all stakeholders so it's a really quick the short this quick profit cycle is a really quick way to create a lot of anti clients of people who are committed against our organization and remember everyone is watching so overall that the cycle that occurs every time we do a service delivery or transaction for products or services that's the overall pattern and that's the service cycle use this to help us look at how our interactions and transactions work thanks for watching do look at the youtube description for links to

"chunk_index": 0, "text": "who are our stakeholders what do they do what are their responsibilities their roles their relationships it can be an awful lot of them not more than we think and it's also useful to remember that a stakeholder is anyone who can will the sharp-pointed stake in our direction so we use a tool called the holomap to map the stakeholders set of different views the service itself the internals its transactions the direct interactions and the indirect interactions this helps us to place the stakeholders which clarifies what they do where they are what their relationship is with them and their relationships with each other so typically we'll start with the organization as the surface itself which doesn't have any stakeholders because it's the thing that stakeholders have relationships with within map the stakeholders in the organization's internal services the IT in more and we then map three layers outward from the organization the first is the enterprise of transaction with suppliers the whole supply chain the transactional work with customers and the rest now we look at the market who are stakeholders within the market such as recruiters and so on on direct interactions and finally we look at the indirect interactions with people who we don't interact generally with as such but they can have huge impacts on us now so far this has been kind of abstract so kind of yawn so let's make it come alive let's add the human dimension with some simple minifigures we start off with the organization as a whole that kind of us represented here by a manager sitting in that position of the organization for somewhere down in IT with the rated relationship between IT and the business we might think that their business is the only stakeholder that matters but actually we're going to need to have a whole lot of other services that we relate with who might also be stakeholders there's facilities there's accounts there's production there's planning there's engineering all in addition to what we've seen with just the IT and remember these may be under our direction but they're never truly under our control that distinction is important now we look at the immediate supply chain the obvious ones like supplier and customer but we actually need to think much more much more broadly about not just the supplier but the suppliers supplier not just the customer but the customers customer and also any prospects supplier prospects and customer prospect when only to look at the stakeholders in the broader broader market there are our competitors of course everyone thinks about those but there's also the regulator's there's recruiters there's journalists those analysts those trainers there's many others all of these they don't interact with us on the main supply chain but they do have direct interactions with us beyond that there's a kind of shared story these are people who interact only indirectly at times but can have huge impact on us things like the infrastructure and other broadcast scope services that keep our business going there's the families in the community the families of our employees the families of our customers have everyone else there's government there's politics that's what's happening in other countries to them the ones who are doing that can change the whole story on us there's the big picture the observers of the whole story people who are keeping track of how well we keep our promises there are the anti clients the people who believe we've already broken our promises and who will work very hard to prevent us keeping our business and there are hackers and other criminals who just want to make money or make destruction for the sake of it these are indirect in stakeholders but we need to be aware of them the cookers this their stakes can be very sharp so when we look at the whole of the enterprise the whole space there are a lot of interactions a lot of stakeholders so we started with the organization of service we took the classic IT centric view we expanded it out to internal services IT and more we looked at the immediate and direct in transactions and the whole transaction web we then looked at stakeholders in the market the direct interactions that we have and there did the shared story stakeholders the indirect interaction so we start looking at this in terms of the switch with that without any stakeholders just ourselves but we need to include all of the internal services who might be stakeholders we need to add the internal plus the transaction stakeholders we need to add the direct interaction the mark the stakeholders from the market in the market space we need to add those from the overall story the whole enterprise stakeholders internal transaction direct interaction indirect interaction so we use the holomap to map these stakeholders for the organization as a whole or we can use it in another way just for any service by placing that one service as the center and mapping out word from there so we use the holomap term help make sense of stakeholders their roles their relationships their responsibilities and their interactions with us that's what the holomap helps us to do thanks for watching do look at the youtube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to

0, "text": "in this video we'll look at a tool called simper which is a way to map out power issues within the organization the fundamental dichotomy we're looking at here is that the physics definition of power is the ability to do work whereas most social definitions power is the ability to avoid work they realize some very interesting problems from the organization's perspective so on the model we have in the middle that kind of yellow band is a kind of neutral and mid-range looking above what we're building increased responsibilities R increased choice to work with power and in below the line we have dysfunction both passive and active avoiding of work and a spiraling avoiding of work so looking upward power is seen as the ability to do work people gain value real value from just doing the work itself we all know that when we've done something well it feels good looking downward with this spiral the ability to avoid work the trouble is that if we avoid work then the work that needs to get done doesn't get done and so often there's a desire to prevent others from working too in mix in case it makes them look bad so even let's get work gets done it tends to be highly addictive so the classic answer to this is to put some kind of Massenet in charge to try to take control to make sure that needed work happens the trouble is that that immediately sets off a reaction it sets up passive dysfunction it's not my job mate I'm avoiding work I'm offloading responsibility onto the other so we end up with it's not my job down tools it particularly happens if people see it as unfair and not work is addictive this avoidance of work is addictive because no actual work gets done so that drags others down into active dysfunction and because it's addictive it goes from bad to worse there's a blame spiral everyone blaming everyone else for things not happening and it be slowly moves too propping self up by putting other down it then spirals even further if we're not careful into really bad the kind of situation where the police are called in so that's when the martinet and the regulator demand to take control and everyone gets lined up but if you're kind of an internal military-style command and control someone telling us what to do and everyone is watched and controlled and measured but again that spirals down particularly when we get the regulator involved who's trying to force everything from the outside which is the kind of double layer of forcing so it spirals down all over again and we see this so often in business environments but behind that there are people who want to do the work workers get engaged particularly when comes out of people understanding difference a simple example example of this perhaps is economics allowing for difference allowing for different perspectives using the fact of different perspectives is often a way to break through a lot of log jams we need us to need a much more human boss rather than a martinet to help build balance to help bring it back if people get fully engaged with that diversity we start getting people who will take it to a further stage that further stage is what we might call wholeness responsibility there's a feeling of I am the company I am responsible for everything that happens here but whole responsibility is really important is where huge power happens but it's often hard to maintain given all the pressures to pull us back in particular we need some kind of vision or continuity to main to help us maintain that wholeness we need to in fact need vision as a guide anywhere above command and control but the regulator will want command and control because they're afraid of us falling back the result of them of being afraid of us falling back is that we go right there way back to active dysfunction again it can break down everything that's going on force it all the way down and we lose all the value from people being committed to the work so the boss really has a choice we've got to keep the regulator at bay but we need vision to lift the value of the work up to keep your people committed to power as the ability to do the work all we're going to be fire fighting against active dysfunction people propping themselves up by putting others down so they're kind of line up we can see here going all the way from a kind of police to control the things going really bad to a the rules-based structure the kind of military style of everyone has defined roles and everyone is performing to that defined measures we've got this mid-level command and control we've got the supporting difference in variants and the importance of vision to really lift people up into wanting to do the work we're also going to balance the external demand of the regulator who always wants command and control which risks pulling everything down so power is the ability to do work or is it power is the ability to avoid work that's what we're mapping with semper
