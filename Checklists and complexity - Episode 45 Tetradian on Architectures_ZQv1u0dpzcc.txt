one of the questions about enterprise architecture that comes up all the time is what can we do to manage complexity it turns out that one of the most powerful tools is also one of the most simple a checklist if you haven't come across this I'd recommend reading it'll go under the checklist manifesto because it's a really good practical introduction to what checklists look like and why they exist and how they help to reduce complexity there are two types quite distinct types of checklist one to prevent problems so that they don't occur and the other is to help resolve problems after they've occurred or as they're occurring one of the reasons for this is we look at the scan framework we can see that there's this difference between the certain and the uncertain or at runtime we cross over the edge of panic so they're fundamentally different concerns one of them is that we have the time to deal with the problem and the other is we want a really high time pressure so a checklist to prevent problems has a typical sequence it can be any sort of length so for example the pre-take-off check the the pre starting the engine check on an aircraft this one here you'll notice how in this particular case it's printed in black and it's oriented as a as a portrait layer in that's a particular layout on the other side when we change over we need a checklist to help us resolve problems and here all of the items are in priority sequence the lists tend to be much shorter rarely ever longer than six or seven items and in the engine out example that we have here you'll notice it's printed a different way around it's printed with different color headings so you don't mix them up but in the engine out test the engine art example notice it's about the thing that people tend to forget so when the engine packs that packs up it reminds people you've got to keep flying at the right speed and then it says fly the airplane because if you don't you're no longer flying an aircraft you're flying a brick so these are two quite different types of checklist the ones that you use when you have time to prevent problems occurring later on and the other kind of checklist that you use when the problem is actually occurring checklists really do help to cut down on complexity and to manage the complexity within
