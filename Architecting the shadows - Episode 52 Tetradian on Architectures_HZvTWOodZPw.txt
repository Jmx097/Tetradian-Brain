in this episode I'm talking about architecting the shadows about the whole idea of shadow IT shadow business models and even shadow management for example when we think about a sub classic sergeant's mess it's actually a kind of shadow management it's dealing with the bits that don't fit the main structure and yet are still within the main concerns the main focus in business shadow IT &amp; shadow for business models at how bottom up experiments are done and how they're proven in real-world practice so we do need to support the shadow it's really important that we don't try to prevent it the kind of top-down architecture police just doesn't work because it destroys a lot of this experimentation that we need to have happen so what we need to do is to find a good way to support it one of the ways is for example is to focus on things like shared services that rather than the risk of having 14 or 50 or several hundred different versions of customer a different definition of how customer is collected in terms of data we focus on having a single source of truth that people can access as services or shared services and then connect through from there we also need to be really careful about the status of shadow it's not something that we want to control as soon as we try to control it in any kind of heavy-handed way it actually ceases to be shadow and therefore doesn't work so we need to have that kind of separation that allowance that sort of quietly in the shadows and yet we also need to monitor it because often if there's something really useful we want to have it there another one is that we want to keep it on purpose as opposed to suddenly wandering off on its own directions we've obviously got to monitor it for quite any kind of questionable behavior but it's also important that we don't let it become business critical because particularly in enterprise architecture my personal experience has been that we've ended up with vast numbers of little business spreadsheets scattered all over the place that no one use known knows now who actually wrote it no one's maintaining it but it's become completely business critical for that particular domain one of our reasons for keeping track of shadow is to make sure that that doesn't happen so we want the shadow we want shadow IT we want even shadows business models we even want in the sergeant's mess kind of style a kind of shadow business management that deals with the things that fit between the care of the cracks but we do need to keep it on purpose we do need to keep track of it we need to keep certain of what's going on and learn from it as well and pass those learnings around and the next episode I'll talk more about how we take from shadow into the mainstream but the main point now is we need to architect for the shadow rather than trying to prevent it
