for quite a while now I've used a tagline for enterprise effectiveness of things work better when they work together on purpose well it's useful to take that whole tagline apart step by step if we say together on purpose what are the things of the enterprise what's the what of the enterprise what's the data what are the objects what are the relationships what is the purpose itself the drivers the brands these are the things of the enterprise how do we get them to work better together then if we're saying things work better well what is work what do we mean by work what is the how of the enterprise to make more effective what are the different kinds of work that all need to link together how do we link those different forms together then if we say things work better well what do you mean by better it's a value it's a quality it's not a simple thing to measure so what is quality what is value in the enterprise how do we connect things to a value how do we measure the value the improvement the quality that we get as we make things work better together and then if we're saying things work better when they work together what do we mean by together what are the ways in which they all linked together to make something work better what are them all the links and interweaving the the connections how do we get all the different people to come together which then brings us to this last point about what is purpose what is the why for the enterprise and remember it's not just about the organization itself we do an architecture for an organization but about the shared enterprise that it operates within so enterprise is the shared purpose enterprises the place where all the different purposes coincide what is this why how do we make things more on purpose so that's a useful tagline to work with things work better when they work together on purpose but what things what is work what is better what is together what is on purpose these are useful questions to explore as we build our architecture
