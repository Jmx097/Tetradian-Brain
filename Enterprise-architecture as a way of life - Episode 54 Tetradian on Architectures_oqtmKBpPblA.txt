the topic for this one I picked up from one of our women colleagues who commented that to her enterprise architecture is not a job it's a way of life and then commented can you talk about this while I'm on maternity leave because I agree with her very strongly enterprising architecture is very much a way of life for me it's about using architecture thinking to connect to all of life all of my life architecture is about how things connect about how things linked to purpose and how we make them take ideas and intentions into real-world practice and learn from them as a continuous process so it really is about all of life and that we can apply it absolutely everywhere it also means that we look at and the other architecture themes such as architecture is relentlessly political a key question for all architecture and architects is how do we get the best for everyone in this particular space in this particular context its political so we're going to be dealing with arguments of all kinds not political in the kind of big picture sense but just simply in the relationship between people and making things work another key theme our key concern for me at least is that architecture only works when it becomes everyone's responsibility when it's taken up as everyone's responsibility so it creating a context where architecture is a way of life for everyone a habit of thinking a habit of acting about connecting things to purpose about connecting things together and building cleanly from the big picture to how are we going to do it - doing something - learning from it and then looping around again as a continuous process so if we think about kotecha as a way of life perhaps consider how does this connect to the architecture of your family the architecture of the society and community in which you live the architecture of religion and how people connect to religion and how it gives them a sense of purpose how does it connect to politics in the mainstream sense of the term how does it connect to our legacy because architecture is about the long term how does it connect to life in general if we think of Enterprise Architecture not as a job but as a way of life it actually opens up a lot of very interesting possibilities that we can use in many other places beyond our suppose at work
