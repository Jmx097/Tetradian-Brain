# Analysis: Introduction to Seven Sins diagnostic - Tetradian on Tools for Change

## Executive Summary
The video introduces the **Seven Sins diagnostic**, a framework by Tom Graves to identify common failures in switching between skill-modes (Artist, Scientist, Believer, Technician/Builder) during projects and change initiatives. These "sins" represent patterns of **ignorance or indiscipline**—not moral evils—that lead to business and project failures, with advice to maintain discipline in mode-switching. It urges viewers to use the diagnostic to avoid traps and check blog posts for deeper details.

## Key Takeaways
- Failures in enterprise architecture and change often stem from **lack of discipline** in moving between skill-modes: Artist (ideas), Scientist (testing), Believer (vision), Technician/Builder (execution).
- The **Seven Sins** are: **Hype/Hubris** (rushing to Believer on untested hype), **Golden Age** (assuming past/future ideals without examination), **New-Age Nuisance** (avoiding discipline by jumping modes evasively), **Meaning Mistake** (half-baked ideas or unchecked assumptions into production), **Possession Problem** (assuming "I have the truth" or rights without responsibility), **Reality Risk** (confusing "as-if real" imagination with actual reality), **Lost in the Learning Labyrinth** (misreading learning breakthroughs as mastery).
- Resolution involves **tracking current vs. needed modes** and switching cleanly, following sequences like idea → alpha test → beta test → production.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Apply the diagnostic** by monitoring your current skill-mode against the required one at each project stage; resolve sins by enforcing disciplined transitions (e.g., test assumptions before production).
- **Check assumptions rigorously** at every stage to avoid the Meaning Mistake—example: verify supply-chain fragility as exposed by events like the coronavirus pandemic.
- **Follow classic development cycles**: initial idea → alpha test (expect failures) → beta test (check failure points) → pre-production → production only when proven.
- **Avoid scaling prematurely** (Reality Risk): ensure readiness for real-world consequences of imagined ideas.
- Review linked **blog posts** (in YouTube description) for expanded tools on mode-switching and sin-avoidance.

## Quotes
- "The word **sin** is not come it's bad but it's actually if you look at the historical meaning it just means **ignorance** it means a failure it means it's not bad it's not evil it's just these are things that we need to watch for and make sure that we resolve."
- "Most of these sins arise from a **failure to switch between the [modes] correctly**."
- "**Is** and **as if** it were... certain that something **is** true [vs.] **as if** true are very different things it's really really important not to mix up."
- "The way we resolve these is we need to **keep track of what mode we are in at each time versus the mode that we need to be at each moment in time and move cleanly between them**."[1][2][5]
