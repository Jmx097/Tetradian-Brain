# Analysis: How to model a business glossary - Episode 51, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video outlines a practical approach to modeling a business glossary by starting with industry standards, using capability models to identify stakeholders, and conducting workshops to map local variances via a thesaurus. It emphasizes accepting differences rather than seeking perfect consensus, implementing a searchable tool like a "Jargon Buster" for ongoing maintenance, and treating the process as continuous rather than a one-time project.

## Key Takeaways
- Start with existing glossaries, industry standards, and specifications as a base, then adapt for organizational specifics.
- Use a **capability model** to identify actors (people and roles) and relevant business areas for input.
- Conduct workshops focused on context-specific variances, local acronyms, and relationships like "is the same as," "is an extension of," or "is a subunit of" using thesaurus standards such as Dublin Core.
- Accept that full consensus is impossible; instead, map local meanings and use the glossary/thesaurus as an anchor for ongoing conversations.
- Implement a continuously updated, searchable interface like a "Jargon Buster" with a moderator to handle matches, warnings for similar terms, and self-maintenance by users.
- Store and access the glossary visually through simple tools that link definitions and relationships, enabling organizational sense-making.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Step 1: Research base materials** – Lookup existing glossaries, industry standards, and specifications to establish a starting point.
- **Step 2: Identify actors** – Reference the capability model (from prior episodes) to find relevant people, phone numbers, and directories; ask around for those already working on similar definitions.
- **Step 3: Run workshops** – Use the base glossary to discuss variances, local acronyms (e.g., 15 meanings for one acronym), and build a thesaurus with terms like "is different from," "is an aggregation of"; map relationships per Dublin Core standards.
- **Step 4: Publish and maintain** – Create a "Jargon Buster" tool (top-right screen interface, voice-enabled today) that generates wiki-like pages showing definitions, matches, and warnings for sound-alikes (e.g., ISO as International Standards Organization vs. Internal Service Order).
- **Step 5: Govern ongoing** – Appoint a moderator for continual updates; users maintain entries collaboratively, accepting differences to work effectively across the organization.
- Prioritize capability-model alignment for starting areas and visual storage for simplicity.

## Quotes
- "The first place that we want to start with glossary is to find existing glossary x' lookup industry standards lookup industry specifications and use those at least as a base."
- "We are never going to get actual consensus what we need to do is to map out local meanings and build a consensus locally often at the time but have something use the thesaurus and the glossary as an anchor for conversations."
- "It's not a project it's a continuous process... people maintained it themselves working through a moderator."
- "Accept that you will never actually get consensus what you do is accept differences and work with them."
