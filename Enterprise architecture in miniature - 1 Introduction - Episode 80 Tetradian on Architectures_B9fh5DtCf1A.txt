one of the themes I've promoted right the way through all of my work in enterprise architecture is that we should be able to apply the same principles at every scope and scale I've often talked about our bpe a really big picture enterprise architecture where we take it up pretty much to the scale of a planet but how about what it looks like when we come all the way back down again to a one-person organization now I want to be able to go around and teach and to do that I'm going to have to do something to build a vehicle that is purpose-built for that need that is fitted out as an office and so on but they're still being able to live in it because I've got to be able to travel around what michael van life as an example so the first one first stage of this is to say look at this from the story perspective what's the story here should we choose the enterprise that we want to get involved in well in my case I want to look at travel I want to be able to do research I want to engage with people and I want to be able to document it with writing with video with voice and any other means that are appropriate I've also got to be able to eat live rest play and so on so there are very tight practical constraints I've only got an ordinary driving license so I can't take a vehicle larger than about three and a half tonnes that means that for a typical large van I've got a maximum fit out of about one not one and a bit tons which is quite a lot sounds like a lot until you try to fit out an entire vehicle I've got to fit multiple uses into that space into a very small space it's probably no more than about 11 to 15 feet internally and only about five and a half feet wide and in terms of the width of the vehicle I've got to be able to write in there I've got to be able to record video edit video I've got to engage people I've got to move around from place to place and again I've got to be able to eat sleep and so on these are all different functions that have to be fitted into that space I've also gotta fit a vast amount of stuff into that space everything that's needed to support each type of use and there are a lot of different uses so I've got to make very detailed multiple use multiple function for almost all of the space that all of it has to work together now when we compare that to classic enterprise architecture which focuses pretty much only on IT yes IT is part of this I'm going to need IT to deal with communications particularly internet connections with commit with connecting with people with support for all of the video and so on but straightaway it should be obvious I hope that there's vastly more here than just the IT and so the architecture of this enterprise has to cover the whole story not merely centered around a team
