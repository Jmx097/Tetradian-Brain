# Analysis: Measuring mythquakes: Episode 98, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video introduces a **mythquake scale** from 0 to 9 to measure the impact of conflicts between untested assumptions (myths) and reality, drawing parallels to earthquake scales. It emphasizes using enterprise architecture to assess risks, prepare interventions, and practice on smaller mythquakes to handle larger ones, particularly in organizational and societal contexts.[1]

## Key Takeaways
- A **myth** is an untested assumption; a **mythquake** occurs when it collides with reality, with severity based on impact on lives rather than energy.
- The scale ranges from **Mythquake 0** (daily upsets) to **Mythquake 9** (extinction-level myths like possession and "it's all about me"), paralleling Richter (energy) and Mercalli (impact) scales.[1]
- Examples include Mythquake 1 (mortality realization, affecting ~200 people/minute), Mythquake 3 (job loss, thousands affected), Mythquake 4 (politics, 10,000+), Mythquake 5 (economic crashes, 100,000+), and higher levels involving beliefs, identity, rights, and global responsibilities.[1]
- Enterprise architecture primarily deals with Mythquakes 3-4 (work/politics) but must address rising threats up to Mythquake 9 via social media and diversity issues.[1]
- Practicing on small mythquakes builds tools for larger ones, making this scale vital for risk identification in architecture.[1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Use the **10-level mythquake scale** to measure impacts: start with everyday Mythquake 0 (e.g., "that didn't work"), escalate to assess scope (e.g., lives affected: 100s at level 2, 10,000s at level 4).
- In **enterprise architecture**, prioritize interventions at levels 3-4 (job loss, politics) by identifying myths around work identity and policy assumptions; scale up to level 7 (diversity/identity) and 9 (possession myths).
- Prepare by "practicing on small earthquakes": analyze low-level daily mythquakes to develop tools for high-impact ones, integrating into EA for risk mapping and reality-testing assumptions.[1]

## Quotes
- "A myth in this context is an untested or unverified assumption something that we assume to be so and a myth quake occurs whenever we have a conflict between that myth and reality."
- "Practicing on the small earthquakes allows us to work on the big ones from an enterprise architecture perspective."
- "Social media in which we live is heading very fast towards some very real myth quake 9 level myth quakes we need to deal with faced with these we need to start tackling them and we need the tools to do it."
