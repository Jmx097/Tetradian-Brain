# Analysis: Enterprise architecture and coronavirus: Preparedness: Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary

The video discusses how organizations must prepare for prolonged, wave-like disruptions similar to the 1918 flu pandemic, rather than assuming the crisis has ended after initial improvements. It emphasizes the need for after-action reviews, adaptive organizational structures, and tactical preparedness for random, localized disruptions rather than widespread shutdowns.

## Key Takeaways

- **Post-crisis complacency is dangerous**: Historical pandemics show second waves are often worse because people relax their guard and assume threats have passed.

- **After-action reviews are essential**: Conduct reviews with no blame, equal status for all participants, and focus equally on what worked and what didn't to extract lessons for future disruptions.

- **Disruption patterns will shift**: From widespread simultaneous closures to random, localized hotspots that create unpredictable challenges requiring different response strategies.

- **Asset and resource management matters**: Understand where assets are located and develop the ability to move them quickly to respond to random disruptions.

- **Fungibility and adaptability are critical**: Organizations need interchangeable resources and the capacity to adapt operations on-the-fly, drawing lessons from disaster response (e.g., Hurricane Katrina).

- **Organizational structures must be flexible**: Stable conditions require hierarchical structures, but chaos requires lateral communication networks where hierarchy functions as information flow rather than command and control.

- **Top-down support is vital**: Leadership must clearly communicate that employees have permission and support to deviate from standard procedures during disruptions.

- **Risk and opportunity are paired**: Every risk contains embedded opportunities (e.g., organizations discovering remote work viability), and these should be examined together.

- **Essential workers often go undervalued**: Recognition that lowest-paid workers were most critical during the pandemic highlights systemic inequities requiring organizational attention.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials

**After-Action Review Process:**
1. Establish a no-blame environment where all participants have equal status
2. For each action taken, document: the original plan, whether a risk management plan existed, what actually happened, and the actual disruption data
3. Identify the source of differences between planned and actual outcomes
4. Give equal weight to what worked and what failed
5. Extract lessons applicable to future disruptions

**Preparedness Checklist for Random Disruptions:**
- Inventory your assets and their current locations
- Develop procedures to rapidly relocate assets to mitigate localized disruptions
- Identify which functions have interchangeable resources or staff
- Create protocols for on-the-fly adaptation and decision-making at lower organizational levels
- Establish clear communication from leadership about acceptable deviations from standard procedures during crises

**Organizational Communication Restructuring:**
- Map your current command-and-control hierarchy
- Develop alternative lateral communication networks for crisis scenarios
- Reframe hierarchical function: shift from command authority to information distribution
- Train middle managers on empowering front-line decision-making during disruptions

**Risk-Opportunity Pairing Exercise:**
- For each identified risk, explicitly document potential opportunities
- Use this pairing to identify capability gaps (e.g., remote work infrastructure)
- Prioritize investments in capabilities that address both risk mitigation and opportunity capture

## Quotes

- "The reality unfortunately is that the current virus is anything but finished."

- "There's a real danger about being lulled into thinking that it's all over" (referencing historical patterns like the 1918 flu).

- "Most of the so-called essential work in the coronavirus was people who are the lowest pay but still the most involved without which things don't happen."

- "When it's going into real time chaos which is what the battlefield is essentially...the hierarchy is a hierarchy of information flow rather than a hierarchy of command."

- "We never get risk without opportunity; we never get opportunity without risk—so we need to work with them always as a pair."

- "A lot of organizations had believed before that they could not do work at home well now many organizations have found that yes they can and they can do it very fast indeed."
