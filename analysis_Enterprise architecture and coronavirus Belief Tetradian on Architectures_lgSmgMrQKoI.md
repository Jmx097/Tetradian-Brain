# Analysis: Enterprise architecture and coronavirus: Belief: Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video warns that over-reliance on unquestioned beliefs and assumptions during the coronavirus pandemic hinders effective enterprise decision-making, as it filters out real-world observations and leads to poor adaptations. Speaker Tom Graves introduces "Gucci's paradox" to highlight how beliefs distort perception, urging constant testing of assumptions using tools like the scan-frame. In enterprise architecture contexts, this emphasizes questioning "obvious" truths to sense reality accurately amid rapid change.[3]

## Key Takeaways
- Excessive belief in old assumptions applied to new contexts like the pandemic creates huge risks, including "policy-based evidence" instead of evidence-based policy.[3]
- **Gucci's paradox**: Things must be believed to be seen, causing decision-makers to skip sensing real changes and repeat failing actions.[3]
- Use the **scan-frame** (a variant of scanner-frame) to distinguish assertion (proceed as if true), belief (act as if true), and faith (proceed knowing we don't know); start with "I don't know."[3]
- Watch for red flags like phrases "it's obvious," "everyone knows," or strong emotions, signaling belief over observation—shifting from science to "religion."[3]
- Test beliefs continuously to avoid delusion; the sense-make-sense-decide-act cycle fails when beliefs bypass sensing.[3]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Test your beliefs**: Visit the speaker's web blog post "Bending Reality" (link in video description) for a "scary little test" revealing how much of your actions rely on untested assumptions rather than observations.[3]
- **Architect's mantra**: Adopt "I don't know, it depends, just enough detail" to counter belief-driven certainty; apply in enterprise planning to reassess assumptions amid pandemic changes.[3]
- **Monitor language and emotion**: In discussions or planning, flag "it's obvious," "it's always been," or emotional intensity as signs of belief; pause to observe reality instead.[3]
- **Cycle check**: Ensure decisions follow sense → make-sense → decide → act; test if beliefs are skipping the "sense" step, especially in volatile contexts like coronavirus impacts on enterprise architecture.[3]

## Quotes
- "Things not only have to be seen to be believed but also have to be believed to be seen."[3]
- "The danger with belief is we start from I know this is the truth and when we do that we end up forgetting to look at the world."[3]
- "Watch out for key words like it's obvious or everyone knows... the moment someone says it's obvious it probably isn't."[3]
- "In order to see reality we have to be able to question what we believe."[3]
