# Analysis: A question of ethics - Episode 66, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video critiques the lack of ethics in enterprise architecture, highlighting how professionals and consultancies promote ineffective frameworks like TOGAF and bimodal IT despite knowing they fail outside narrow IT contexts. It argues that a true profession requires an explicit code of ethics, calling for open conversations to address dishonest sales practices and prioritize truth-telling to clients.

## Key Takeaways
- Enterprise architecture lacks a defining professional code of ethics, with frequent promotion of fundamentally flawed methods such as TOGAF (limited to IT-centric uses), bimodal IT, and trickle-down economics.
- Big consultancies often withhold truths from clients, such as the IT-centric model's breakdown post-cloud adoption, prioritizing what clients "want to hear" over facts.
- Personal anecdote reveals industry resistance to honesty: the speaker was rejected from a consultancy job after insisting on telling clients the truth.
- Without embedding ethics explicitly, enterprise architecture cannot claim professional status; ongoing efforts and links are mentioned for further discussion.

- When advising clients, prioritize truth-telling to enable informed decisions, even if it risks professional backlash—contrast this with the risks of promoting unworkable solutions.
