# Analysis: Power and enterprise architecture: a checklist - Episode 70, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
This video presents a practical checklist for applying power dynamics in enterprise architecture, defining power as the ability to do purposeful work rather than avoiding it. It emphasizes identifying work needs, resources, responsibilities, risks, system balances, and oversight to address the political challenges in architecture work.[6]

## Key Takeaways
- **Power** is the ability to do work as a personal choice with purpose, linked to responsibility as the ability to choose appropriate responses.[6]
- Identify **the work to be done**, including changes to physical assets, data, relationships, and alignment to enterprise purpose.[6]
- Assess **energies and resources** needed to enable the work and create space for it to occur.[6]
- Determine **who has power and responsibility**, factoring in skills and experience for handling complex contexts.[6]
- Evaluate **risks** like systems propping themselves up by suppressing others, deadlocks from competition, or energy waste.[6]
- Check for **systems offloading responsibilities**, such as open-loop operations expecting others to close the loop or unchecked work production.[6]
- Examine **balance points and interlocks** for system fairness, ensuring maximum purposeful work across the enterprise.[6]
- Question **who decides fairness**, including checks on those overseers to prevent waste from offloaded responsibilities.[6]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
The video provides a step-by-step **checklist for power in enterprise architecture** to tackle its political nature:
1. Define **the work**: What needs changing (physical, data, relationships) to align with purpose and aims?[6]
2. Identify **resources**: What assets, energies, and abilities enable the work?[6]
3. Assign **power and responsibility**: Who has the skill to choose appropriate responses in messy situations?[6]
4. Assess **risks**: Look for competition, deadlocks, or suppression wasting energy.[6]
5. Detect **offloading**: Spot systems pushing responsibilities elsewhere without assessment.[6]
6. Find **balance points**: What interlocks ensure fairness and mutual efficiency?[6]
7. Verify **oversight**: Who watches the watchers? Ensure checks apply to all, preventing unfair decisions.[6]

## Quotes
- "Power is the ability to do work rather than the very common tendency to regard power as the ability to avoid work to offload it onto others."[6]
- "Power in relation to the rehabilitation responses is what we mean by responsibility."[6]
- "That's a checklist that you can use live in real work in enterprise architecture tackling the relentlessly political nature of so much of enterprise architecture work."[6]
