# Analysis: Enterprise architecture and legacy-systems - Episode 47, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video emphasizes that enterprise architecture must encompass both new and existing legacy systems, rather than focusing solely on greenfield development. It uses technology adoption life cycles to explain why legacy systems remain valuable, urging architects to learn from and integrate them instead of ignoring or rejecting them. Legacy technologies, even at the "laggard" stage, offer reliability and innovation potential for ongoing operations.

## Key Takeaways
- Enterprise architecture involves working with existing legacy systems, as pure greenfield sites are rare, and architects must consider the full technology life cycle.
- Technology diffusion follows stages: innovators (new ideas), early adopters (making ideas usable), early majority (integrating with existing context), late majority (exploiting what's already there), and laggards/stayers (maintaining old tech reliably).
- Legacy systems like COBOL in banking or magnetic core memory in military applications remain useful due to proven reliability, such as resistance to electromagnetic pulses.
- Late-stage users (laggards) act as innovators in their domain, preserving knowledge that can inspire new cycles, and should not be dismissed.
- View enterprise architecture holistically, accounting for whole-of-life cycles and the reasons legacy systems persist.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Map your organization's position in the technology life cycle (innovator, early adopter, early majority, late majority, laggard) to understand how new initiatives must integrate with or exploit existing systems.
- Assess legacy systems for unique value, such as reliability in niche scenarios, before planning changes—treat them as assets to learn from rather than liabilities to replace.
- When designing architecture, prioritize compatibility with "what already exists" starting from the early majority stage, ensuring step-by-step integration to minimize disruption for late majority users.

## Quotes
- "Enterprise architecture is not only about the new but about what we've got already I'm working with what we have we rarely work on a pure greenfield site."
- "Think of COBOL programming language still being used in banking or even things like core memory the old magnetic core memory that's still being used in very old military systems because it isn't affected at all by electromagnetic pulses."
- "Look at enterprise architecture as part of a whole looking at whole life's whole of life life cycles looking at legacy systems and seeing how weak work with them rather than ignore them."
