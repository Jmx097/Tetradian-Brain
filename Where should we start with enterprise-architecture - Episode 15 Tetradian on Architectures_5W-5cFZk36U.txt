another useful question this time from Pat Ferdinand II who asks where should we start in enterprise architecture where do we start from the top the bottom the middle from IT only well ITA is often the best place to start or the easiest at least simply because there are so many frameworks and so many tools in that space everyone knows toga fall or fearful don't f they're all there they're all bad IT primarily the crucial thing with we start with IT is to remember that it is only one part of the whole and not the only thing we should be focusing on top-down is another option starting top-down with strategy and then feeding down towards execution to some extent TOGAF is geared for that but that depends on a hierarchy that actually works because often we'll find in a business environment that there are huge gaps between what the executive think is going on and what is actually happening in the real world the other one is bottom-up starting from again from a single area or single single domain the catch with that is that the politics are often very tricky it's difficult getting funds there are huge political problems where we need to move across and connect between areas particularly when you've got the wrong kind of hierarchy our skunk works is an example that often works but that means that there may be a problem when we try to Bridget Bridget watts comes from the skunk works an experimental area into mainstream production my own answer is start anywhere start anywhere that works what we could might call spiral out middle out would we start anywhere and then kind of spiral out from there in a holograph form we need the big picture first there really is no doubt about that we need the support from the executive but then we start anywhere that we know we can deliver value and move outward from there the driving principle is that if we say that things work better when they work together on purpose then we find somewhere where we show that there is value in connecting things together so that they work better together we then spiral outward connecting more bits and then more bits and then more bits we need to use a frame that will support this such as my own framework called Enterprise canvas but we can talk about that at another time the main work I'll point about where do we start is start anywhere that works the crucial thing is to get started at all
