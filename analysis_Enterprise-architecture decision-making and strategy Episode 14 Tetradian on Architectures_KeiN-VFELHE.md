# Analysis: Enterprise-architecture, decision-making and strategy: Episode 14, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
Enterprise architecture (EA) supports strategic decision-making by distinguishing long-term strategy from short-term tactics, using tools like holomaps, enterprise canvases, and Wardley maps to map vision, stakeholders, services, and risks. It emphasizes a human-focused story, closing the loop with performance and learning, while architects recommend rather than decide.[5][6]

## Key Takeaways
- Strategy focuses on the big-picture vision (unchanging), measured in years or indefinitely, unlike short-term tactics mistaken for strategy.[1][7]
- Use **Five Elements** framework: **Why** (vision), **Who** (stakeholders via holomap), **How** (services via enterprise canvas, change, innovation, lifecycles, kurtosis risks), **What** (situational awareness via Wardley maps), and close with performance/learning.[3][6]
- EA supports **sense-making** and decision-making without owning choices—architects recommend, clients decide.[5][7]
- Prioritize human aspects, stories, and relationships; address long-tail **kurtosis risks** where ignoring them wipes out short-term gains.[1][2]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Map stakeholders and relationships with a **holomap** for big-picture overview.[3]
- Use **enterprise canvas** to consistently map services across all levels.[3]
- Apply **Wardley maps** for transitions, innovation spots, standardization, situational awareness, and choice visualization.[1]
- Follow sequence: Identify **Why** (vision), **Who** (stakeholders), **How** (change/innovation/risks), then **What**; assess performance, lessons learned, and benefits.[3][6]

## Quotes
- "Enterprise Architecture is always about supporting the **sense making** when we support decision making but generally speaking we should not be the people who decide to find either strategy or the decision-making for strategy we can recommend but the choices always remain with the clients."[5]
- "Strategy is about how we're enacting or reaching out towards enacting the **vision**... the thing that never should never change if we change the vision we're no longer in the same Enterprise."[1]
- "Kurtosis risks or the long tail risks the ones where if we ignore them we get benefit for quite a long while but then when the will they enact when they come to reality... the gains that we've made from ignoring the risks are actually wiped out and much more by the costs."[1]
