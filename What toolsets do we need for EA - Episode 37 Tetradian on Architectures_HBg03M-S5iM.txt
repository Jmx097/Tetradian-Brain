Alec Blair asked me about tools and tool sets what tool sets do I need friends of brass architecture and he commented that as a musician I remember vividly one of my teachers saying that it's a poor artist who blames their tools well if we think about how we do architecture the actual process is what's known as the squid which is a kind of wild chaotic happening as we start doing the initial research and it slowly settles out towards a plan something solid and certain and then we loop back to the beginning which dumps us back in the chaos again so what we need from tools for the kind of messiness and also formal rigor at the same time friend or further any kind of architecture is the tools essentials that covers the whole of the squiggle unfortunately what we mostly get is tools that fit on one bit of the squiggle and they don't connect this is the problem what are the other core problems is that most of these so-called enterprise architecture tools are still rigidly IT Century to match the frameworks that are still hopelessly IT centric for what we actually need in fact quite a lot of the tools that we have are just vaguely repurposed software design tools which is completely different to the kind of things that we need which are about how we explore how do we play with things and they also do another problem that they have is that they're very good at the design end of the squiggle but very bad at the messy end and again they don't connect also each of the tools or so many of the tools run what we might call a walled garden you can use one tool but it won't connect with any other at all so you have to pick a tool that will do as close as you can to your needs but know that it won't connect anywhere it'll help with cope with scale the better ones but it won't actually cope with everything you need so many of them actually end up being worse than useless because they hide critical parts of the architecture that we need to work with particularly as we go from big-picture scope down to operations and as we go from organization out towards the enterprise so the only thing I've seen so far that gives any kind of glimmer of hope on how think getting things to connect is the arc you might exchange file format but even that is based on occupied which is still yet another IT centric framework and is still nowhere near appropriate for what we need and again is geared towards design not to experiment and messing around we need something that kind of covers the whole toolset ecosystem from Scrolls on a whiteboard photographs scratch scribbles on paper all the way through to formally checked even executable code we don't have anything that covers this space yet and there is still a very real need for it so there's a whole market space for the first person who really understands what I've been saying on this about how to connect across the whole space with any kind of tool the other mistake a very very common mistake and I've actually been involved in a couple of these is that someone says let's do architecture in which case the first thing we'll do is buy an enterprise architecture tool don't do this all you will do is waste a very large amount of money on something that you'll possibly never need never use and maybe well never need always start out with understanding what your needs are first and then look for a tool that fits it also strongly recommend getting hold of Archie which is a free download a open source does the job one enough it's argument based but it does the job well enough to help you understand what an architecture tool can do and not do and then help you design decide if you want one of the large expensive ones purpose-built proprietary ones then that'll help you decide which one will actually fit your needs because you'll know what your needs are so what we need are tools that cover the whole of the squiggle we at all that is rigidly IT centric will not help us if we're trying to as it as we can to an architecture that is larger than just the IT space we need tools that can connect across the whole of that space and connect us between all the different types of tools including things like Scrolls on a whiteboard and it's really important not to leap in and buy the most expensive tool you can find without understanding what your needs are that's how I described the toolset space at the moment
