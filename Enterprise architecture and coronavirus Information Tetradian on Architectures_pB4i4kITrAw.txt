hi there I'm settled in in my hotel with so I may as well get on with what my call my quarantine diary this reminds me of a lot of an incident some years back with a problem with an AK and aircraft being too late taking off too late and all the connections breaking as a result it's a blog post called where is the information when we need it and that's one of the characteristics we had here that the information we had was confusing misleading so much so that for example the person who'd offered to let me stay at their house realize that the new of the new information they couldn't do it so completely confusing information in fact when I arrived at Perth I had one set of information about covert 19 and what I had to do when I arrived at Melbourne a completely different set of information so there's often conflicting information the one characteristic of any disaster any problem area even minor upset is that where is the information when we must need it so from an enterprise architecture perspective what information to people need at each point what is the information they likely to need when things go wrong that's the thing we need to look at there's a crucial part of our enterprise architecture work what is it the falls between the cracks what happens to the people who don't fit the standard expectations who don't in my cases for example have a home to go to because I'm literally moving from one country to another on the day that I left rigid rules just don't make sense for people who don't fit within the cracks so we have to have some kind of adaptation to deal with rip the complexities of reality department when something has to cover everyone then a simple set of rules that only work for some people it's not going to work all we're left with often is to deal with in in a practical sense is the people who've fallen through the cracks those are the ones that benefit when I got to the airport to Melbourne Airport there was no one to give me any advice I had no idea what the rules were I had no I know where to get a mast nowhere to get in fact any information at all so these are typical problems that occur whenever there is confusion misinformation lack of there there's also practical things we can do this hotel where I'm staying they normally had a buffet for breakfast that forgotten to tell me that I couldn't actually come out and get it so I did go downstairs but they closed down the buffet instead had already had printed a tick the Box routine where if the food was only being handled by the by the staff themselves and that utensils were only being handled by the staff themselves so their paths for infection were much reduced as a result but also there was simple social distancing people were well spaced apart so there are lots of practical things we can do that when we look at that from an enterprise architecture perspective what are the needs when things change how are we going to set things up to make it work and also from a very personal perspective I've already said our best grow for the longer term so that various colleagues have my access numbers and my passwords so that if I don't make it through this mess then at least you will still have the information that I have available so we can each do something about what we can practically do in a difficult circumstance where the normal rules don't work
