in the previous video we looked at this tool called the skills map which helps us map out what skills are going to be needed for what type of thing and what level of skill were likely to need as well so the levels we have there the the distance from action where a training is really minimal skill their route following rules that working at the point of action but apprentice is focusing their attention away from the point of action because they're learning theory they're learning rules they're relatively they're still low skilled rather but they're low skilled rather than minimal skill they're not at the point of action when they're doing that part of the work and said they're following following and extended rules that more theory than just rules a journeyman is the next level up has to be able to deal with higher levels of uncertainty actually beyond the boundary of certainty this is the first real level of skill as a person who simply rote learning they are dealing with patterns and guidelines those kind of areas those kind of mild mid-level uncertainties but they're still expecting to be supervised and also they're not while they're doing that while they're learning they're not at the point of action as opposed to a master who has to be able to deal with any level of uncertainty at the point of action now the learning sequence is actually the opposite of the classic science development sequence inside sweetie we talked about idea of hypothesis Theory law but it's actually the opposite way around the master is the one who's dealing with ideas the the journeyman is developing hypotheses it's dealing with with working out ideas but not actually there and the front of action this the the apprentice is still working on the theory part and the the trainee is working only on rules or law I was a huge that occurs between although on the one side the the feeling the idea so the idea of the law this fixed that it's awkwar-- we call the Harriet Harris's parity barrier so there's an issue there about the learning sequence is the opposite way around which means were going against the current all the time all of the focus in conventional trainee tight structures is to prevent people having new ideas that's not you know check your brain in that the door was the famous description of Taylorism the only their masters who in this case actually were just the theory the apprentices were setting the rules now that gives us another important problem because one of the huge dangers of the apprentice level is that it's now got just enough knowledge to understand I just never wanted to get into serious trouble but nothing like enough knowledge to be able to get out of it again they also have a much stronger notion that because they are bet quotes better than the trainee therefore they know everything now personally I've often had people who've just done a weekend workshop telling me that they know far more than anyone who's done it for 20 or 30 years this is a classic apprentice mistake we often get an enterprise architecture we often get people have just done the five-day don't care of course telling people who've been doing it for twenty years that they don't know anything because they haven't done TOGAF in my case I literally rewrote TOGAF from scratch to make it work for whole enterprise architecture and I still get people who told me that I don't understand Tokyo because they've just done the training course or whereas I did it ten years ago so there is a very real problem where we have apprentices who have just enough trouble to get enough knowledge to get into trouble and nothing lucky enough to get out of it so there's an issue there there's a similar clash actually between the trainee and the gentleman because the journeyman will do is that the apprentice doesn't know that so that the trainee doesn't understand and they are completely confused in the training see the other one is a very nasty little trap that when we compress time a lot we then have no time for apprentices or for journeyman we've got no time for those that we don't allow people time to learn or to practice there's no for high power efficiency we've got to be just doing the job and nothing else that gives us a culture or a context in which we only have a trainees on one hand and masters on the other and no means to get that for the trainees to the master level we can see this in a lot of organizations to the to production focused or focused too much on efficiency at the expense of actually being able to do the work they work fine until the Masters leave or retire they work fine as long as there's no change even when the Masters gone but the soon as there is any kind of change they fall apart in a heap so for enterprise architects of business architects we need to be really careful to ensure that there is the means to learn the job if that means it's gone then your business is incredibly fragile so that's what we can get from looking at the skills map is how much things have been compressed what the learning processes are as well as the skills mapping itself mapping across from the different needs that we have thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
