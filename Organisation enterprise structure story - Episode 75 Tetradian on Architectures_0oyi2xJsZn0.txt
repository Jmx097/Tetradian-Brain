this episode is a follow-on from episode 71 where it talks about boundaries of the enterprise know a number of questions that came up particularly Michael Pollan one of them was does the organization become the enterprise at what point does the organization become the enterprise and the short answer is it doesn't it can't they're fundamentally different things what I'm describing is the organization is a structure that's centered around rules roles responsibilities possession those kind of ownership those kind of areas whereas it an enterprise is essentially a story it's bounded by vision values commitments a way of describing things it's a why as opposed to the organization's how so they're fundamentally different they actually can't become something else another one was about is this about control or about influence what's the difference the organization seems to be about control the enterprise seems to be a bad influence well it's sort of except that a fundamental question here is that control is actually a kind of myth we hope that it exists the organization is mostly about an attempt to control particularly things that are inside itself so things that are inside its boundary of control as opposed to its boundary of identity which is not necessarily the same particularly when we're outsourcing so there are some really important things to explore around this distinction between control versus influence we certainly can't control things that are outside the organization but we need to understand them in order to make them work another one was about merger and acquisition does this shrink the enterprise well no not really it's it's quite different you're talking about expanding the organization which does not take over the enterprise because the enterprise is a story it's not something that can be controlled it can be owned it can be possessed it can't it doesn't work that way what a major acquisition does is it takes a larger slice of the kid perhaps all the way up to a monopoly where they can to some extent control the market itself but it still doesn't control the story so it still doesn't override to the idea of enterprises story but a final one was about if we're saying the enterprise is a story and it's larger than or we need to look larger than the organization doesn't this imply that Enterprise extends to infinity well she won't answer is yes it does every enterprise is an enterprise of stories a story of story and enterprise of enterprises all intersecting all the way up to the scope of a planet and possibly beyond but that's not practical the reason why we talk about enterprise it's because we're looking at something that is larger in scope than the organization itself typically we're talking about three layers out the trunk the organization itself and the things that can control the transaction space which is suppliers customers and so on the direct interaction space which is about market is about regulators those kind of areas and finally there's another indirect in interactions which are about how the organization intersects with the broader story things like government community anti clients so that's about as far as we need to go in principle we might need to go other beyond because there might well be hiddenness assumptions that we haven't addressed but what we're doing is we're taking out to those three levels because that'll get most of the important assumptions that we need to address
