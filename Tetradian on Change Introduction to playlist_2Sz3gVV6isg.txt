hi i'm tom graves on this channel we already have a playlist for tools for change about how to work with change and methods for doing so i've also got a playlist for architectures or structures that support and stories that support change itself what i want to focus on in this playlist is change itself the ideas the concepts dealing with the feelings and issues around that so it's much more about the personal or the conceptual about how to make sense of change itself that's going to be the focus here i hope you find it useful anyway
