# Analysis: An enterprise architect's checklist - Episode 46, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video presents a practical checklist used by the speaker for large-scale enterprise architecture projects to identify potential pitfalls before transformation begins. It emphasizes clarifying foundational elements like story, scope, and constraints to avoid downstream issues such as scaling problems or structural flaws. This quick pre-project review ensures architectures are feasible, sustainable, and adaptable to real-world challenges.

## Key Takeaways
- Establish **story and purpose** first to ensure clarity on objectives before proceeding.
- Define **scope and stakeholders**, including boundaries, connections, and responsibilities to manage involvement effectively.
- Assess **context, scale, and scaling** to prevent issues that arise as complexity grows, such as those seen in startups.
- Implement **full cycle governance** covering development, maintenance, and safe dismantling to avoid unmanageable endings.
- Identify **structural flaws**, like economics models assuming infinite growth on a finite planet.
- Account for **non-negotiable constraints**, such as the speed of light impacting network latencies in IT architectures.
- Evaluate **resistance to change** from vested interests to plan for adoption challenges.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
The speaker outlines a **simple checklist** to run before any transformation project:
1. **Story and purpose**: Confirm "what's the story here? What are we trying to do?"
2. **Scope and stakeholders**: Identify boundaries, edges, connections, and key people to involve, inform, or keep happy.
3. **Context, scale, and scaling**: Clarify where it happens and how it scales, addressing early-stage vs. growth complexities.
4. **Full cycle governance**: Ensure governance for building, maintaining, and dismantling without catastrophic failure.
5. **Structural flaws**: Check for fundamental mismatches, e.g., infinite growth on finite resources.
6. **Non-negotiable constraints**: Consider physical limits like speed of light for networks (e.g., satellite latency ~0.1s round-trip, protocol handshakes amplify delays).
7. **Resistance to change**: Plan for unwillingness or vested interests blocking implementation.
This checklist acts as a "trick" to preempt trouble in enterprise architecture.

## Quotes
- "If we haven't got clarity on [story and purpose] then we shouldn't be moving on."
- "Things that work really well for a start-up in the early stages... if you haven't dealt with the scaling problem before you start then you're going to hit huge problems."
- "We have an economics model that depends on infinite growth and we are on a finite planet you can't have infinite growth on a finite planet there's a fundamental structural flaw there."
- "The speed of light is a non-negotiable constraint... something that works here across a room may not work across a globe."
- "There's a simple example of a trick checklist that we would use before transformation a transformation project to make sure we don't run into trouble further down the line."[1][4]
