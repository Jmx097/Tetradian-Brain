# Analysis: Enterprise architecture and coronavirus: Digital legacy: Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video discusses the importance of planning for **digital legacy** in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, prompted by a colleague's death, emphasizing how to protect and preserve online content like websites, domains, books, and videos after death, disability, or short-term lapses. It outlines a three-step preparation process—short-term protections, disability contingencies, and death arrangements—while addressing challenges like IP rights, privacy, family concerns, and business parallels to escrow. The speaker urges proactive planning to ensure valuable digital materials remain accessible to others, particularly in enterprise architecture where case studies are scarce.

## Key Takeaways
- **Digital legacy** must be protected through three steps: short-term safeguards (e.g., funding for domains/web hosting via teams/friends), disability preparations (e.g., sharing passwords/backups with trusted contacts), and death planning (e.g., securing death certificates for asset transfers).
- Challenges include legal hurdles like delayed death certificates, intellectual property restrictions (e.g., scarce enterprise architecture case studies hidden as "secret sauce"), privacy issues (e.g., embarrassing content or photos of others), and family income protection.
- Personal digital assets (e.g., 1,200 articles, 25 books, 50 slide decks, 150 videos) risk vanishing without preparation, as seen in the speaker's lost domains and a colleague's scattered online presence.
- Business analogy: Digital escrow ensures service continuity if providers fail, mirroring personal legacy needs amplified by the pandemic.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Step 1: Short-term protection** – Assemble a team or friends with funds to cover domain renewals and web hosting; monitor and backup content to prevent sudden loss (e.g., inaccessible code changes).
- **Step 2: Disability planning** – Share passwords, backups, and access with trusted advisers, colleagues, or agencies; enable them to post updates (e.g., "out of action but okay") on your behalf.
- **Step 3: Death preparation** – Plan for legal requirements like death certificates (which may delay transfers); identify what to share (choices, usefulness), notify potential users, and address IP permissions for old materials.
- Key questions to address: What to share/not share? Why? Who might need it? Respect family privacy, potential embarrassment, and financial value.
- General advice: Start planning now—others will value your legacy more after you're gone; apply to enterprise architecture by seeking permissions for historical case studies.
