right so Heidi meets you're from Australia from the Brisbane isn't it yes yeah we're both at the intersection conference on enterprise design in Lisbon in the Academy understand CS what I'd like to ask you is about how you see the relationship between enterprise design an enterprise architecture mm-hm and particularly what kind of lessons learned that you've got in the work that you've done in the Australian context so in a pro soccer picture traditionally is more aligned to business and more broadly in Europe and other places but in Australia it's still very much centered around the same installation architecture or IT architecture so the language that people use when they describe what they actually do is it's misleading and at points confusing so at the moment I'm manager of business architecture and that term itself people don't really understand it because it's kind of means more business analysis to some people it's a type of people it's more business design but or they don't figure you've got architecture in the titles throws people off so when I introduce myself to people and I usually spend an enterprise architect for the customer business and information domains and that seems to help the the beauty of edifies design opposed to just architecture or enterprise architecture is more that's brings together design and architecture so that people can play nicely together and focus on the problems or opportunities rather than a discipline itself so a lot of the frameworks that I've worked with over the years that they're kind of creating a little bit of friction because they're overlapping and then their language is different so it's confusing so this I think enterprises on something I'm really interested in because it cuts through that and focuses on the value of the solution activity although the early focus in fact my experiences is actually better in Australia rather the worst it's often comes as a surprise to have people in Australia but the other question I had was the one about best source of lessons learned things that you don't tell other people yes about the things that you don't want to repeat this success is that you've had the things that you felt really do work find common ground in the value that you're trying to create don't always wear your hat yeah that's that's my biggest one so of which really hard in places to find common ground with the customer experience guys is my first protocol customer strategy and their data people because a lot of people say well I hear a lot of leaders asking for Aoi and they don't understand that that's business rules plus great data and often aligned to thinking front and back office it's a really great automation for forgot to convert oblems yeah what's the point what's it gonna do that's the first question of it definitely and when you tie everything back to what's what's the value that we're trying to create so are we trying to lower operational costs are we trying to reduce complexity and technical debt and are we trying to make a great customer experience for advocacy then it's much easier to cut through because you're focusing less on what the actual frameworks are telling you or what what what tasks you think you own and it brings it back to their value great thanks very much Thanks Thanks
