another good question from Pat Ferdinand II who asks what do we mean by the term holistic Enterprise Architecture well in a very literal sense we mean enterprise architecture of the whole as whole and in some ways it's a reaction or a response to the way that enterprise architecture is still being misused for things that aren't Enterprise such as the architecture of enterprise scope IT or the architecture of the business and the organization as if it's the enterprise so it's about the whole as whole not just the organization but the organization in its context in order to understand what its context is in order to understand how the organization can respond to it so we look at the story of the organisation of the enterprise we look at the structure of the organization and the enterprise we look at the context to at least three layers out so if we think of the organization as a whole then we're looking at the transaction space that that organization is in the market space or other direct interaction space and this broader somewhat more fuzzy but very important area that includes families communities anti clients investors beneficiaries people like that governments that is we might discover this they're sort of indirect interactions the other point is that we not only to take it outward we're taking it inward architecture is everyone's responsibility we need to connect everyone to the story that is the enterprise because that's what guides decision-making that works particularly at runtime and operations the operations level another aspect of this is about preventing the possession of enterprise architecture by IT alone which is what most of the frameworks are about the existing frameworks assume that is always and only about IT and anything else is peripheral this leads to an architecture that is dangerously incomplete and in some cases actively destructive so it bundles it into a narrow constraint if we assume it's all about our tea it also means it doesn't have authority for all for the Enterprise Architect to move around anywhere within the organization because they're reporting at best just to the CIO not to the whole of the executive which is where they need to be there's another theme as well which is what I call really big picture enterprise architecture sometimes shortened to the robber ugly acronym are BPA an architecture should be able to cover any scope any scale anywhere anyone anything so we should be able to scale it right down to the level of a single web code a single line of work of code but also scale it up to an entire not just an entire organization or an entire industry but an entire country an or even the entire planet we scale we check the validity of how we do architecture by how it scales making sure that it works at each end of the extreme scales so a holistic enterprise architecture is able to look at anything in terms of whole as whole it's not just about the IT it's not just about the organization it's about the context that those operate within
