# Analysis: Introduction to Enterprise Canvas core - Tetradian on Tools for Change

## Executive Summary

The Enterprise Canvas is a **universal framework for understanding services** by viewing everything in an organization through a service lens[6]. It provides a consistent checklist for analyzing any service by examining the tension between current and desired states, the value flows connecting stakeholders, and the products that pass across service boundaries[3].

## Key Takeaways

- **Everything is a service**: The model treats all organizational activities as services, from core operations to supplier and customer interactions, creating a unified analytical approach.

- **Symmetrical relationships**: Customers, suppliers, and the organization itself follow identical patterns—each has desired ends, means to achieve them, and value connections to others.

- **Value flow is bidirectional**: Value flows in both directions across service boundaries, connecting realized ends (current state) to desired ends (goals) through shared values and vision.

- **Core service components**:
  - **Value proposition**: How value will be delivered, connecting the offering to the organization's values and story
  - **Value governance**: Controls and oversight that follow value creation
  - **Interactions**: Occur before (procurement, marketing), during (transaction), and after (payment, completion verification) service delivery

- **Products vs. services**: Products are static outputs (invoices, brochures, payments) that pass across service boundaries, while services are the activities that create value.

- **Fractal structure**: Services contain other services at every level; the same patterns repeat regardless of scope, scale, content, or context, enabling consistent analysis across the enterprise.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials

The Enterprise Canvas functions as a **visual checklist** for analyzing any service[6]:

1. **Identify the tension**: Define what you currently have (realized ends) versus what you want to achieve (desired ends)

2. **Map stakeholder relationships**: Identify suppliers (who provide inputs), customers (who receive outputs), and recognize that these roles are symmetrical—your customer may have their own customers

3. **Trace value connections**: Determine how your values and vision align with suppliers' and customers' desired ends

4. **Document the service cycle**:
   - Pre-transaction interactions (procurement, marketing, relationship building)
   - Main transaction flow
   - Post-transaction activities (payment processing, completion verification)

5. **Define boundary products**: List what crosses service boundaries (materials, information, payments)

6. **Decompose recursively**: Break down any service into its component services, applying the same framework at each level

## Quotes

- "For anything there is a tension between what we have—the realized ends—as opposed to what we want to get towards, which is our desired ends."

- "Everything is a service which we view in the same way, so there are interactions that happen before service delivery which go both ways."

- "It provides us with a completely consistent way of making sense of service relationships... We can look at every interaction, every service in exactly the same way regardless of scope, scale, content or context."

- "It's fractal in that sense—exactly the same patterns happen exactly the same way. Every service contains other services."
