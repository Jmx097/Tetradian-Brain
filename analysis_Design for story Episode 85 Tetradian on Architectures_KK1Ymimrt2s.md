# Analysis: Design for story: Episode 85, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video presents the enterprise as a **story world** extending beyond the organization, where shared concerns, actions, and drivers like "ideas worth spreading" from TED define trust and value through agreed-upon principles. Organizations position their own storylines within this world, forming alliances with "coopertition" partners rather than just competing, to create interdependent networks. Enterprise architecture emerges from understanding these story flows, enabling **design for story** across relationships and beyond organizational boundaries.[5]

## Key Takeaways
- The **enterprise** is a story world encompassing everyone involved, defined by shared elements: what everyone acts on (concern), drivers (the "why"), and actions taken by all players.[1][5]
- Trust in the story world relies on all players complying with shared values distinguishing "good" from "not good," enabling the world to function.[5]
- Organizations position their storyline within the broader story world, with **allies** (related but non-competing entities) forming supportive networks, exemplified by Hay-on-Wye's secondhand bookstores specializing in genres like military history or sci-fi.[5]
- **Coopertition** examples include the "mend my chair" enterprise, where hardware stores and services interconnect without direct competition.[5]
- Customers exist in their own stories; organizations must appear in **customers' experiences**, not force customers into organizational processes, as per Chris Potts' insight.[5]
- **Enterprise architecture** derives from mapping story flows through the organization and its story world relationships.[1][5]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Identify your **story world**: Define the core concern (e.g., "ideas" in TED), action (e.g., "spreading"), and driver (e.g., "worth spreading") that all players share.[5]
- Position your organization: Map allies (supportive, non-competitive partners) and competitors (same positioning) to build interdependent networks, avoiding a sales-only mindset.[5]
- Apply to architecture: Use the enterprise story to guide decisions on services and relationships, ensuring alignment with customer experiences rather than internal processes.[1][5]
- Example framework from related work: Anchor business and enterprise decisions to a core story (e.g., a cafe's "small-child friendly" vision drives layout, art walls, and customer segments).[1]

## Quotes
- "The enterprise it's not just the company it's actually a **story world** a world in which we and many others appear."[5]
- "Customers do not appear in our processes we appear in **their experiences**."[5]
- "It's not the customers appear in an organization story we appear in **their stories**."[5]
- "The **architecture develops out of that understanding of story** of how the story flows right the way through the organization and beyond in all of its relationships in the story world."[5]
