in this video we're going to look at after-action reviews as a way of looking at continuous improvement as supporting as continuous improvement it's got a similar focus to five elements as we saw in the print in a previous video but it has a different start point as you'll see after actual review started out in the military where they really did need to have continuous improvement on the job fast in real time was then taken up by police by emergency services and various others in that kind of field and started taken up by industries such as construction and oil the fundamental rule of an after-action review is that there's no blame you pin your stripes at the door we need that as a vision to hold up everything together no blame means that if there is blame no one's going to learn anything and also pin your stripes at the door is about that you are everyone had their own responsibilities so we each need to improve on our own no one's more important than in than any other in a review so the first step is what was meant to happen for that we need some kind to have been some kind of plan which again you'll see connects back to five elements from there we are say what actually happened what was the action well we don't spend much time on this we're just concerned with what actually happened no comment at all then we start looking at what was the difference between the plan and the action both bad and good it's easy to miss the good we want to look also for one of the sources for the difference and the reasons for the difference because those are things that we can learn from once we do that we then want to look at what what can I learn to do differently next time to do it better are going to connect the individual back to purpose back to the why the core principles involved here and we do it for each member of the team it's not that we look at one person only in each case we're looking at the whole are looking at each person then we move on to we learn as a team we as a collective rather than a set of individuals so we learn as a team how can we improve our coordination between each other as a team so to reprise it was used first in the military then moved on to emergency to construction to oil and so on we now see them taking up much more by business but in fact it's available to everyone it's really useful to be able to do an after-action review after every kind of action so we've got this vision of continuous improvement that will hold everything together the vision helps to hold all together as individuals and as a team so that first step is about what was meant to happen what was the plan what was what actually happened the action what are the differences the source of differences the reasons for difference what can we then move on to what can we learn for this what are the commitments that we start to make about what I will do to do it better next time and we then move on to what can we as a team do to coordinate together how can we learn and make commitments to do our job better as a team so after-action reviews are for everyone it's an action to support continuous improvement in every type of action thanks for watching do look at the youtube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
