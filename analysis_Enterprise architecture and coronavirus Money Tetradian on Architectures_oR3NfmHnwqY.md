# Analysis: Enterprise architecture and coronavirus: Money: Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video critiques the money economy as a flawed system for resource management, exposed by the coronavirus pandemic's disruptions like mass unemployment and undervaluation of essential low-paid workers. It argues that money inherently directs resources to where they are least needed and proposes rethinking economics entirely without money, using simple needs-based exchanges instead. Enterprise architects are implied to play a role in redesigning sustainable resource flows beyond possession and money economies.[2]

## Key Takeaways
- The pandemic highlights failures in the money economy, such as arbitrary classification of "essential" vs. non-essential jobs, leading to 22 million unemployed in the US and exposing lack of savings.[1][2]
- Essential work (e.g., healthcare, cleaning, bus driving) is done by lowest-paid workers, while higher hierarchy roles remain secure, revealing an inverted pay structure for societal value.
- Money as "currency" relies on flawed valuation and hierarchies, directing resources inefficiently to where least needed, unlike a needs-based approach ("what do you need?").
- A moneyless economy could eliminate non-essential institutions like banks and insurers overnight, as high streets would prioritize tangible goods over financial services.
- Possession and money economies are unsustainable long-term, necessitating a complete global economic rethink focused on resource management.[6]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Rethink resource allocation:** Replace every monetary transaction with the phrase "what do you need?" to prioritize needs over valuation, applicable in enterprise architecture for modeling efficient flows.[2]
- **Audit economy structures:** Walk a high street or mall to identify shops/institutions that would persist without money (e.g., essentials like food) vs. those that vanish (e.g., banks, taxes), using this to redesign viable economies.
- **Enterprise architecture application:** Use pandemic insights to model non-monetary systems that ensure resources move to where most needed, avoiding money's biases in hierarchies and valuation.[1][2]

## Quotes
- "Money... is essentially our only main means of managing resources and the flow of resources... but depends on this rather odd idea of valuation that some things are valued as higher than others."
- "The closer you get to doing real tangible essential work the less you get paid; this is an odd way to structure an economy."
- "We can replace every single monetary agenda transaction with the one short forward phrase 'what do you need?'"
- "A money economy or a possession economy guarantees that the resources will naturally move to where they're least needed not to where they must need it."
- "We don't actually need [money]; it's a really bad way to manage resources... there's some really interesting ways and interesting challenges about how we rethink our entire economics at a global scale without money."[2]
