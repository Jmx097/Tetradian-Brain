in this series of videos we're looking at the score frame very simple frame to help us make sense of strategic issues in fact pretty much any kind of choice or any kind of business issue so one of the challenges that people have is where do we start I've just done it as a the kind of scroll that we were doing a notebook or on the whiteboard so that's how it would typically be used where we would start is always from the initial question that we have in this case how would we expand our market into Asia we typically also start from what are the success criteria the things that define quality for us strengths are capabilities that we have challenges are things that we don't yet know how to do options are opportunities or risks that we see in the outside world typically and responses are whatever we get back from the outside world rewards raging x' reactions whatever just responses of any kind so in this case of how would we expand our market into Asia the obvious point here is this is an opportunity so we're seeing the opportunity of Asia opportunity new market but also risk new market what are the risks that are coming out of that place because options opportunity and risk we always treat as flip sides of each other we never look at one without looking at the other so the opportunity one of our effectiveness concerns our definitions of success is business growth and learn from everywhere so that fits well that's a good opportunity it may have risks involved particularly around value for money we're worried about whether we would waste a lot of money try to build it with it not getting anywhere and we've also got watching one other thing that's very real which is if we put all of our attention into the new market will we kill off the old one the existing one the one that we're using to build the new market we've got to keep aware of what's going on with existing so there's a challenge there straight away we've got to be really careful if we go into that new market that we're not cannibalizing that we're not going to waste money so the challenges here then would be how do we keep track of costs how do we keep awareness of our exert of impact on market so for that for both of these we want to look for responses from the market we want to get information where will that information come from well for that we've got so if we take that back again where will our information come from some of it will come from our existing systems but some of it may not so I'll put a comment there about existing systems because that also helps us link to if we don't have the right system we want to be learning from there which will again lead us back to what are the responses that we're looking for we can look for responses not just wait for them so we can also look at what are our existing systems what can we use for the new market versus don't have and need that we will need to add but when we have them we will then have them for the Asia market which means we may have new points they're learning the new market again brings us back to here but it links very strongly to both learning from everywhere which will then give us a capability to learn about other new markets what we learned from going to the Asia market we could apply to the Africa market as well so the point here is that we start from one place and the crucial point here is that we're looking for the right questions once we find the right questions the answers that we need tend to fall out on their own we allow the conversation to wander in this way but notice what arises as we do so so that's how we might you score to help us make sense of a new option thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
