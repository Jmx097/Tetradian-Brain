with coronavirus hitting pretty much everywhere almost everywhere is now in a lockdown and we don't know how long that's going to last quite possibly several months but we need to be preparing and planning right now for what we can do when the lockdown ease is off we need to be getting ready because once the lockdown ends we need to move so various tools from my own toolkit that may be useful and that are documented on the on the YouTube channel the the tools for change channel first one perhaps is scan that helps map out the the complexity the uncertainty and shows us what we know or what we need to know what is inherently uncertain and what we can possibly do to move the uncertainty to split the uncertainty apart into the bits that can be known whereas the bit as opposed to the bits that will remain unknown that we have to work on at real time there's several ones here including talking about checklists next tool is visioning and the reason why this is so important is because it gives us an anchor in the midst of deep uncertainty having a clear vision a simple statement that anchor that identifies the overall enterprise really helps in keeping things stable in the midst of wild change next one is a tool called score which again there are a lot of videos on that here which help us to guide decision-making understand our choices our challenges what the capabilities we have and how we can use them to work with it capabilities the strengths our capabilities the challenges that we face that become capabilities once we resolve them the options which are always opportunities and risks combined the responses and returns that we're looking for from the real world and how they connect to overall effectiveness that's one that what we're really after here behind that is a tool called holomap which again is documented in several ways here that helps us map out who our stakeholders are and in particular for this purpose find out who our allies are because we're going to need all the help we can get as we come out of the mez and finally the most important tool of all perhaps is an after-action review a continuous process of learning that supports the learnings that we need as we iterate through rapid change after-action review has really said five very simple steps what was supposed to happen in the work that we've just done what actually happened in the work that we've just done what was the source of the difference between plan and action what can I learn to do differently to do better next time and what can we as a team do learn to do better and commit to doing better next time so those are five tools that are immediately available that are completely open you're welcome to use them as much as you like the videos are all along that tetrode into a tools for change channel so make use of them as best you can good luck and stay well
