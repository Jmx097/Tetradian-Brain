# Analysis: Enterprise architecture and coronavirus: Comedy: Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The speaker argues for incorporating levity, playfulness, and comedy into enterprise architecture practices during the coronavirus crisis to counter excessive seriousness, prevent blame, and foster learning in high-stress environments. By designing for small "happy endings" and moments of relief, architects can help teams stay sane and effective amid rapid change. Comedy is framed as a successful story outcome that balances tragedy's unhappy endings.

## Key Takeaways
- Excessive seriousness or blame hinders learning, especially in fast-changing situations; after-action reviews must enforce a "no blame" rule to enable effective reflection.
- Playfulness in enterprise architecture, illustrated via tools like toy theaters and toy trains, uncovers overlooked issues such as service intersections and collisions.
- Architects should intentionally "architect for comedy" by embedding small successes, safety moments, recovery periods, and learning opportunities to prevent team burnout under stress.
- Laughter and black humor act as medicine, providing relief from tragedy and absurdity, ultimately driving toward successful outcomes.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Use playful tools for experimentation: Employ a **toy theater** as a low-stakes "traitorous designer" checklist to identify easily missed elements in architecture.
- Model service design with a **toy train** to simulate scenarios where services intersect, clash, pass by, or operate over/near each other without direct connection, revealing hidden issues.
- Design architectures for relief: Intentionally create structures that deliver "the smallest of happy endings" (e.g., celebrating minor wins like "one of them actually worked") and include moments of safety, recovery, and learning to support teams in overload.
