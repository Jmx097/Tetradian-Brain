this video is about a tool called score which helps you map out options and capabilities in a given context I'll use a live diagram to illustrate this what we have here is the score tool sheet as used in the preparation room the third room in the five element series but here we're largely using it as a standalone basic structure is that we have a focus question that we're working on then we have five domains we can move around between on the one side the stuff that's happening inside the strengths the shallot the capabilities that we already have and challenges the uncertainties and the issues that we need to deal with internally that when we resolve them can themselves become strengths on the other side the outside world we have opportunities risks options openings all kinds of things which we can see we're looking for and the responses the reactions the real-world evidence that's coming back to us and between them as a kind of bridge is how do we become more effective so what we've done here what I've done here is chosen an issue which is we want to work on better customer support the criteria that we want to check for effectiveness we've committed ourselves to being more customer oriented but we also needed to be cost effective now when we look at the question about better customer support a response we're getting from the real world is not the right information which is a surprise to us because we have what we think of as strengths our FAQ online manuals and a call center a support call center when we thought they were enough but so if we think of that as bridging between them what it's telling us is that we are at risk loss workout risking losing customers if we don't get this one right so we're going to look at what's going on but the key word here is that word not the right information so what have we got so it's not what the customers actually need from us if we look over here that we're now getting immediately a challenge of what is the right information and how can we better deliver it as we look at this we start thinking hang on the call center is not actually giving the right information the call center is all that the call center is doing is following scripts which is not cost-effective so I not curse customer-oriented it's not giving us what we need so instead of having though the people who can follow scripts and answer standard stuff which is already on the FAQ and in the manuals what people want from us is the right information which means we need the most experienced people in the call center to give the stuff that's not in the manuals so we need a training mechanism that is cost effective that will bring us a new kind of call center which in turn could create an opportunity for sales in consulting but we'll need to see what the response is for that so what's happening here is rather than just making lists we're using the categories to lead us around in a dance to see where it leads each thing leads to the others and we build a new picture looking for new ideas information and insights that will give us the information that we need and give us the act show us what the actions to take following on from this exploration
