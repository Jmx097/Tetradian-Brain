a bit of a different video this one the other day I was asked to talk with the group of Italian Enterprise architects about interference architectures for chaos for extreme circumstances such as that right now we're facing with coronavirus what are the issues that we need to address well the first one is that this is an obvious issue where we need whole enterprise architectures rather than calling IT architecture enterprise architecture the the IT is an important part as we'll see in a moment but it's not the only bit it's not the only bit that matters in fact far more words the people issues so it was the first point the second point was that when we're dealing with chaos we have to be able to deal with the emotional aspects to go with it which means we'd need to design for those emotional issues one of the themes that came up in the conversation was the importance of avoiding guilt to minimize guilt to avoid blame because those things don't help when we need to make decisions fast what they do slow things down so things will go wrong I've had I'm reminded straightaway of the response of the Walmart CEO who said that this was during Hurricane Katrina he says this organization will respond rise to the level of this disaster many of you are going to have to make decisions well above your level you're going to have to make those decisions with very limited and often wrong information do the best you can with the information that you have available and do the right thing as best you can so we have to support people in making decisions which are emotionally difficult to do so information systems really do help but they need to support that not get in the way another one is that particularly when we're dealing with a major pandemic people are going to die and therefore guilt is a natural response but we have to be able to work with it rather than hide from it another one very important indeed is that if this disease seems to particularly particularly serious for the older people which means the most senior people in your organization if people are having to be shut off and maybe even be at risk who is shadowing them who knows what decisions those people make what kind of shadowing mechanism or body mechanism do you have for collecting these more senior people to younger people very much like the old idea of a secretary with someone who carried your secrets we need to be supporting the younger generation to take over in a hurry if need be so what are our mechanisms to make that happen another important theme is that even in the midst of chaos there are usually small fragments or small areas that actually are quite predictable we need for example to know where our resources are so that we can move them in a hurry who is who is the risk area where are the risks where are the resources who can move those resources in whatever way necessary it also helps to highlight a lot of the hidden risks and a lot of the design business designs we've had just-in-time manufacturing just-in-time logistics systems are very risky when there are things missing halfway through the sequence the whole tyre system can break down so it's a bit of a wake-up call to understand what when architectures we need for when things go unstable the difficulty is that we have to do it in real time right now [Music]
