I'd like to do a short series now on the question of power what power is and where at its relationship is to enterprise architecture one of the things that we come up with a lot is that Enterprise Architecture is described well as relentlessly political were always dealing with people and we're always dealing with power issues so there's a model I use called semper which is very helpful in tackling power issues and what it bases on is a really simple dichotomy the physics definition of power is the ability to do work but far too many social definitions of power are the ability to avoid work or to entrap others into doing our work for us the trouble is that if power is the ability to avoid work then ultimately no work gets done which means that we don't have things completed so the simple scale the Sempra scale it uses is from actively dysfunctional where things that really everyone is tied up with the ability to do to avoid work to hold this responsibility where each person is utterly committed to doing that whatever work is necessary to get the enterprise to work this is why it's so important in enterprise architecture because we're very concerned about work being done in an effective way so the first one is that is a an understanding that power the ultimate source of power is actually only from within the self it's like a live like an inner fire then we have to maintain that fire we can have power with where we work with each other to help each other find that power from within a kind of neutral command and control is not very successful it's trying to limit things if you think of classic Taylorism you're using only a very limited amount of each person's power that fits with the pigeonhole that we've put the person in so it's a very inefficient use but at least we're getting some kind out of the situation we've then got the first stage a kind of passive dysfunctionality where people are avoiding responsibility they're offloading responsibilities to others they're trying to blame they're trying to avoid it's not my job mate it's not in my job description all these kind of things what we might call power under where we conceal really just how much we're avoiding work but the trouble is that less and less work gets done eventually we end up with what we call power over where we prop our selves up by putting others down a classic dysfunctional competition for example we'll use up all of the available energy in the competition and ultimately no work is done at all so the usual relationship to power which is the idea of win or lose that I win because you lose and therefore if I put my mad effort into making sure you lose I believe that I win the kind of transactional model it's actually an illusory form of lose-lose the apparent short-term win for the self marks the longer term lose for everyone including the so-called winner so they're really the only viable choice that actually exists around power is either everyone wins or everyone loses and we need to get it to a point where actually everyone wins that's the real question of power that we need to address in enterprise architecture about making sure that the ability to do work and the valuing of that work occurs because otherwise everyone loses
