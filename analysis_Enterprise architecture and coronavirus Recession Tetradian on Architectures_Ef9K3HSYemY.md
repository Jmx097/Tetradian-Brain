# Analysis: Enterprise architecture and coronavirus: Recession: Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video presents an enterprise architecture perspective on the impending global recession triggered by coronavirus, emphasizing that risks like economic shutdowns reveal systemic flaws in debt-based structures and offer opportunities for reset. Speaker Tom Graves advocates using tools like SCOR to assess strengths, challenges, options, responses, and effectiveness, while promoting collaboration, asset identification beyond debt, and replacing monetary transactions with need-based sharing to build resilience.

## Key Takeaways
- A global recession is highly probable due to coronavirus, halting incomes while debts and payments persist, exposing unsustainable economic structures likely to fail over months.[7]
- View risks as paired with opportunities for reset, highlighting dysfunctions in the economy and enabling collaborative rebuilding at business and personal levels.
- Apply SCOR framework (Strengths, Challenges, Options, Responses, Effectiveness) to evaluate capabilities, assets (e.g., human connections for joint storytelling and structures), and real-world feedback.
- Challenges resolved become new capabilities; responsibilities entail symmetric risks and opportunities.
- Foster collective action—"we're all in this together"—by sharing with others and gauging effectiveness against personal or organizational criteria.
- Propose replacing every monetary transaction with "what do you need?" to identify and serve needs, preparing for recession through support networks.[1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Use SCOR analysis**: Assess your situation by listing **S**trengths (e.g., non-debt assets like people-connections), **C**hallenges (turn into capabilities once solved), **O**ptions (treat risks/opportunities as pairs), **R**esponses (from real-world feedback like reactions/rewards), and test against **E**ffectiveness criteria for purposeful collaboration.
- **Identify assets beyond debt**: Inventory capabilities such as connecting with others to co-build stories and structures in new ways.
- **Shift to need-based economy**: For every transaction, ask "what do you need?" to map needs, then determine how to serve/support them collaboratively.
- **Prepare for reset**: Look for economic redesign that makes "real economics work," focusing on sustainability over one-sided debt structures.

## Quotes
- "Whenever there's risk there's also opportunity we need to look at all the ways from the opportunity if only for the possibility of a reset."
- "We're all in this together the only way out of this is to really work together with others rather than think solely of our own position."
- "In principle at least we could to replace every single monetary transaction with the one phrase what do you need."
- "Check all of them against effectiveness whether what are the criteria that you hold for making that tell you that things are effective how do we make the whole thing work look towards others look towards sharing with others to make it work."
