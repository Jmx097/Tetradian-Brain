in a recent conversation Daniel Fossett and I talked about the meaning of fitness for purpose or fit for purpose what do we actually mean when we use that phrase so the whole question about what Fitness means in a sense the real meaning behind that much misused phrase of the survival of the fittest because what we will do in a real world environment is we will map out what's known as a a fitness landscape how well something fits the particular purpose in each of its different variables so what we're doing is we're mapping out that certain solutions are more fitter than others in different conditions a simple example is the methods that we would use for governance if we look at something like the difference between agile lean versus Six Sigma they apply in very different types of environments if we try to use agile and a sit in a context that is highly stable and must be highly controlled we're doing the wrong approach likewise a very rigid waterfall type approach doesn't work well with something where weari don't know what's going on the question then is other methods that we use fit for purpose and we use a fitness landscape a mapping to tell us which approach fits better in different circumstances the next catch is that what I call variety weather where the variables that were using to map out the changes the Fitness are themselves variable so that we can have not so much a fitness landscape for but a Fitness seascape where things change over time the fitness for something the perfect fit for a one condition no longer applies when the conditions have moved to something else so we can use tools such as scan about the how close we are to real time at close to real time versus the levels of uncertainty in the space we can use tools like that to map out not only that the uncertainty itself but also the uncertainty about the uncertainty and the types of uncertainty that we're dealing with the crucial point here is that in understanding fitness for purpose we need to design for what changes as well as what doesn't we need to design for uncertainty rather than pretend that the uncertainty doesn't exist
