another key thing in rethinking projects is the crucial distinction between explore versus exploit they're really important distinctions are we trying to produce something that we already know what we're going to get or are we trying to explore to find out something well we don't know what we're going to get these have different emphases different products very different concepts of failure and it's really important that we don't mix them up or we're running a project exploit to exploit assumes that there is going to be no significant change of really any kind at all things should go to plan the focus is on the thing of the product of what we're trying to do the emphasis is on efficiency and failure is about failing to produce to the quality specified most production environments of production in a context that's what we're after now an explorer is really quite different it's context is about change it's expecting change and uncertainty the focus is on the info that the information we're after we're after the product is the ideas the information the insights that we collect from the process of exploring and any product any physical thing that comes out of it is a kind of almost a side-effect the emphasis on is on learning and that failure is actually failure to learn not failure to produce the thing so we don't talk about an experiment failing unless the experiment was so badly designed that we didn't get useful information out of it so exploit is about producing is about this fixed thing and we want to apply things like Six Sigma so that we won't have the absolute minimum of variation whereas to explore or the product is the idea that insights that come from doing some work and that failure is only when we fail to produce useful information or useful ideas the very different things they can occur within the same project different parts of the same project but it's really important not to mix them up particularly around the idea of failure don't mix them up
