in this video I'd like to took at economics from an enterprise architecture lens now over the last few years I've been looking at talking a lot about what I called RB PE a really big picture enterprise architecture the principles of enterprise architecture applied at the very large scale right out to a global scale now one of the things that's happened with this pandemic is that it's really highlighted or manner of huge flaws in our current notions of economics one of the things that's useful to remember is that economics literally translates as the management of the household and well most people when they talk about economics talk about money if we look at it in terms of the management of the household then yes sure money is part of managing the house household but it's certainly not the only part and if we compare it to an ordinary household then managing the money while it may not be easy is arguably the easiest part of managing a household so that economics literally means everything in the global context about how people are to relate it's useful to look at it like that rather than solely in terms of money so when we apply an enterprise architecture view it brings us a whole bunch of really simple but really highlighting questions first one is what is the enterprise if we're talking about the architecture of an enterprise what is the enterprise in context well in this context it's really humanity as a whole in context of the world as a whole we don't survive if the world doesn't survive its grab it useful to remember that economics is the wholly owned subsidiary of the environment not the other way round if we don't have an environment to live in we don't have an economics even if only of the monetary kind then the next question is but what are the needs in this enterprise this member was described very well by a a New Zealand premier some years ago when he talked about life love hope and more the things that matter most to people it's also about resilience about a de adaptation about antifragility over an indefinite period of time we have to be able to adapt as things change over time so that loneliness leads us to another question for the architecture which is what are the dependencies well one of them is that in our economics resources are simply not where they're most needed in fact the natural gravity over possession economy is the resources naturally trend towards their leak wherever they're least needed and particularly away from where they're most needed and some resources are not renewable particularly that's a challenge when we talk about the enterprise being about indefinite time and particularly bad when we're being incredibly wasteful about you know consume consume consume as an architecture for enterprise about survivability and thriver both you have a long period of time that's a very poor architecture design so given those immediate concerns and gives immediate focuses we then look at it from a classic enterprise architecture perspective we look at the as is in order to understand what we need to do to move to a to be what we've got really visible now is high fragility a just-in-time supply chain model is not exactly it's not exactly robust when anything in that chain breaks down if there are any delays anywhere in the chain everything breaks down this is not a good design we've also got a low durability with this whole resource wastefulness Helium for example we've only got about 11 years of it left at the moment oh there's no possible replacement but it's not people think oh helium helium toy balloons isn't it no it's not it's things like super cooling for a high high-energy medical scanners like MRI scanners it's also absolutely crucial in an electronics manufacture to a very real extent there's a high probability that no helium equals no electronics well that's gonna put us in some very serious trouble we've also got a huge mismatch between the abstract and the real the money system can go to infinity there's no problem there we can have infinite growth but for everything else we can't have infinite growth on a finite planet so we need to have a look at this really seriously an enterprise architecture provides some disciplines that can help a lot if we start looking at economics with an enterprise architecture lens there's a lot we can discover
