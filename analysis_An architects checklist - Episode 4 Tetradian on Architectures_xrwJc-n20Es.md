# Analysis: An architect's checklist - Episode 4, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video presents the "architect's mantra" as a core tool for managing uncertainty in architecture work: "I don't know," "It depends," and "Just enough detail." It emphasizes that architects must embrace these phrases, paired with the ability to investigate further, to avoid false certainty and achieve balanced decision-making.[1][8][9]

## Key Takeaways
- Architects' fundamental challenge is dealing with uncertainty, requiring honesty in admitting gaps in knowledge rather than pretending to have all answers.[1][5]
- "I don't know" is essential for identifying the right questions; follow it with "I know how to find out" or "I know who to ask."[8][9]
- "It depends" highlights interdependencies and relationships that must be mapped for systems to work together purposefully.[4][8]
- "Just enough detail" avoids analysis paralysis or overlooking critical elements, balancing detail levels contextually—though it loops back recursively to the other phrases.[1][4][5]
- The mantra forms a recursive framework: questions about "just enough" often return to "I don't know, it depends."[1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Adopt the mantra in practice**: When faced with a question, start with "I don't know" to frame the right inquiry, then specify how to investigate (e.g., research methods or contacts).[8][9]
- **Handle "It depends"**: Identify dependencies and interrelationships systematically—map what everything relies on to ensure purposeful integration.[1]
- **Determine "just enough"**: Assess context to balance detail—avoid over-analysis by focusing on what's needed to get the job done, using guidelines rather than rigid rules.[1][2][3]
- **Respond to challenges**: If asked for specifics on "just enough detail," reply recursively: "I don't know, it depends," then proceed to find out.[1]

## Quotes
- "The fundamental of our work is always about uncertainty so there are three phrases that we'll find ourselves using a lot and we need to know how to work with them three phrases are **I don't know** **it depends** and **just enough detail**."[1][8][9]
- "When we say **I don't know** we need to be able to respond by saying **I know how to find out**."[8][9]
- "When we say **it depends** we need to be able to say **and I know how to find out what it depends on**."[8][9]
- "There's **just enough detail** in each so becomes somewhat recursive."[1]
