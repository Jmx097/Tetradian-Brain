exploring this process of enterprise architecture and miniature about applying the same principles right down to the level of a single person organization and their architecture their enterprise so far we've looked at the big picture we've looked at the first steps we've looked at how there are multiple scopes and particularly worked on one of them now what we want to do is go down into the beginnings of moving from scopes towards plan and to do that we start looking at prototypes now I'll pick a single part of this overall idea that we're working on which is the idea of a digital know myself being a digital nomad working to move around to show to teach to demonstrate to put all of these architectural ideas into real-world practice by teaching it by demonstrating it by helping people build their own so of all of the scopes the one that I want to look at here is the one that needs the most practical approach straightaway which is the feasibility of actually doing the vanillite pit the rest of its fairly straightforward but the van that I'm living in a van is going to be a key part of it we need to make sure that it works so to do that we shift now from architecture towards design we want to apply the design criteria the success criteria to the build scope so we now need to build virtual prototypes it's expensive to test very expensive to test something out in real all the time we're going to save a lot of effort and time just simply testing with virtual prototypes so we're looking at constraints we're looking at priorities we're looking at requirements were looking at feasibility one example here is separation of concerns we want to have only one use visible at a time now there's a lot of uses going on I've got to be able to run course a trellis of a miniature workshop in the space but it's hence the need for a whiteboard for example I want to be able to do filming editing tool development all of those kind of things in that space as I'm moving around working with other people but I don't want to have it all mixed up with the living space the bed the the kitchen whatever so I want to have separation of concerns such that only one use is visible at a time I've also got to look another concern is that utilities demand what is the power requirement and how am I going to service that what is the water requirement how am I going to service that another one is looking at things like requirements for storage and for access because there's an awful lot of stuff in a very small physical space I've got to store everything to live for a month or so at a time and work with all of the tools for work for a month at a time how am I going to do that how's it going to work where's everything going to go everything depends on everything else I also need to look at feasibility look at the cost look at the time look at the effort if it's too much cost then it's not worth doing I can sort that out through virtual prototyping getting some grasp of what is the actual cost the effort and so on and one of my concerns that I have is about reuse I want to make sure that there's no structural change to the vehicle that the vehicle could be used just as an ordinary van if necessary or if I want to sell it on then it doesn't require someone to demolish an entire mess and have pre-built stuff so for example typical in a van are rails that you can connect things to so that you can add bits and move bits out change it as it goes along so I know it's going to change so I need to design for change design for the changes in usage and so on and the point about an architecture is that each of those prototypes codes all about connecting everything to everything else it's not just designing one bit how it works as a whole that's where it becomes architecture as well as designed
