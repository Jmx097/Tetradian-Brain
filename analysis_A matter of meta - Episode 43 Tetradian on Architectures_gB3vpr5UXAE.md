# Analysis: A matter of meta - Episode 43, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
No single enterprise architecture framework fits all contexts, as real-world needs in sectors like telecommunications and logistics require custom adaptations. Reference frameworks enable local standards while maintaining compatibility with broader ones, and **metaframeworks**, **metamodels**, and **meta-methodologies** provide recursive guidance for building tailored, compatible frameworks that preserve uniqueness.[6]

## Key Takeaways
- No universal framework exists; all must be adapted to fit specific organizational needs, such as in Australia Post where a custom one was developed.[1]
- **Reference frameworks** act as local adaptations of standards, ensuring compatibility by clearly distinguishing **same** (for learning from others) and **different** (local uniqueness).[1]
- **Meta** concepts are recursive: a **metamodel** models how to build models, a **metaframework** guides framework creation, and a **meta-meta model** creates metamodels.[1]
- Adaptation retains compatibility by starting from existing frameworks, amending based on local context, and using patterns to track changes.[2]
- This approach allows organizations to innovate uniquely while benefiting from shared knowledge across frameworks.[1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Start with an existing framework as a base rather than inventing from scratch to retain compatibility.
- Use a **same-and-different** analysis: identify what remains unchanged (for cross-learning) and what must be adapted locally.
- Apply **metaframeworks** recursively—treat them as tools to question and modify: ask "What's missing? What should be different? What to add/delete?" and iterate on the model until it fits the context.[1]
- Document adaptations carefully to show alignment with the original, enabling patterns for future use (e.g., in exploratory architecture phases).[1][2]

## Quotes
- "No one framework fits everything there is no the framework for enterprise architecture."
- "A reference framework is a local adaptation of some kind of standard that provides a local standard but it's still compatible with the larger space."
- "The term meta is actually an indication that it's gone recursive a meta model is still just a kind of model but it's a model whose job it is to show us how to build models."
- "By using meta frameworks and metamodels meta methodologies we can build ones that are compatible with others while still retaining our own uniqueness our own unique flavor in the space."
