this week's question comes from Emma Court who asks what's the career path to enterprise architecture my short answer to that one would be there's no set career path it often people often come from IT but by no means all I've met up with real architects a product designer someone who actually designs the architecture of another one was a marine biologist another one was an ecosystems developer so people come from all different paths it's not just from IT the main characteristic that links all Architects together is how things things link together that's the real important characteristic links of that is that there are various levels or domains at which different architects work as what we might call the solution architect who's dealing with all of the details for a single area how those linked together a single project then we've got a domain architects like security architecture or business architecture or IT architecture where we're focusing on the detail on the system what specialists but we focus on all of the detail an Enterprise Architect a whole Enterprise Architect is by definition dealing with the whole has to deal with how everything works together across the entire space so a solution architect tends to have a lot of understanding of how things work at the practical level of the detail level at the implementation level and often that's what we might call a t-shaped specialism when people start to specialize into a single domain but crucially they have to be able to connect across the whole space or connect with others they don't need necessarily deal with others they will connect with other architects in a team to get into a connection of the whole then we've got a lot from that list of the solution architect is often the first stage of architecture and any technical domain at all when people finally realize that things do need to work together and work together better then we might call what we have might call donkeys ears it's kind of there's a core specialism such as security or data architecture or applications architecture or process architecture is another where there is a core specialism in one area works but a very solid understanding of how all of those different domains link together and how we connect across different spaces and finally we have what we might call a cone-shaped which is a lot of understanding of different areas you can never understand or have an understanding of everything but we need as architects to be able to link across every different type of specialist speciality so we need to have just enough just enough understanding to be able to ask useful questions across any domain or between any two domains if we're connecting finance and HR or IT and logistics from anything to anything we're talking about the whole enterprise as a solution to a particular question a particular story so the career path to ei is can come from anywhere it tends often to come from IT but that's actually a problem in a sense because we need the diversity of experience but the other crucial one is be interested in everything be interested in anything learn how to learn fast those are the really the career paths to an enterprise architect role
