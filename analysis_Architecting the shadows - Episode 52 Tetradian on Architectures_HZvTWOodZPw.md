# Analysis: Architecting the shadows - Episode 52, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video advocates for intentionally supporting **shadow IT**, **shadow business models**, and **shadow management** as essential for innovation and handling aspects that don't fit formal structures. Instead of suppressing them through top-down control, enterprises should architect for these shadows by providing shared services, monitoring without heavy interference, and learning from them to integrate valuable practices into the mainstream.

## Key Takeaways
- Shadow elements like IT, business models, and management (e.g., a sergeant's mess) address gaps in formal structures and enable bottom-up experimentation proven in real-world practice.
- Top-down "architecture police" stifles innovation, so shadows must be supported rather than prevented.
- Use **shared services** and a **single source of truth** (e.g., unified customer data) to reduce redundancy while allowing shadow activities.
- Avoid controlling shadows heavily, as this eliminates their value; maintain separation, monitor quietly, and prevent them from becoming unmaintained business-critical artifacts like scattered spreadsheets.
- Track shadows purposefully to detect useful innovations, questionable behavior, and lessons for broader application.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Implement **shared services** as a single source of truth for common data (e.g., customer definitions) to support shadow experiments without duplication across teams.
- **Monitor shadows lightly**: Observe without heavy control to identify valuable practices for mainstream integration, while preventing drift into critical, unmaintained systems.
- Keep shadows **on purpose**: Regularly learn from them, share insights organization-wide, and avoid letting them become business-critical without oversight.
- Prepare for transition: Use monitoring to move proven shadow innovations into formal structures (detailed in the next episode).

## Quotes
- "We do need to support the shadow it's really important that we don't try to prevent it the kind of top-down architecture police just doesn't work because it destroys a lot of this experimentation that we need to have happen."
- "As soon as we try to control it in any kind of heavy-handed way it actually ceases to be shadow and therefore doesn't work."
- "We want the shadow we want shadow IT we want even shadows business models we even want in the sergeant's mess kind of style a kind of shadow business management that deals with the things that fit between the cracks but we do need to keep it on purpose."
- "The main point now is we need to architect for the shadow rather than trying to prevent it."
