# Analysis: Modelling multiple forms of value - Episode 40, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video emphasizes modeling diverse forms of value beyond money—such as trust, ideas, health, safety, and reliability—across all organizations, as every enterprise pursues multiple "profits" driven by its core story and vision. It advocates using tools like Enterprise Canvas to track value flows, transformations, and pervasive services for monitoring, ensuring alignment with non-monetary drivers even in commercial contexts. This approach prevents failures like eroded trust in banks or self-insurance models by architecting deliberate awareness, enactment, and measurement of key values.

## Key Takeaways
- Organizations must identify and track multiple value forms (e.g., trust, ideas worth spreading) that feed into their unique "profit," as money is often secondary to core drivers like those in TED's mission.
- Conventional money-focused models ignore other values by converting everything to currency, leading to poor outcomes; instead, model value flows and transformations explicitly.
- Use **Enterprise Canvas** to map how values move through the organization, monitor effectiveness at each step, and apply pervasive services (e.g., health/safety, security) for awareness, enactment, runtime execution, and outcome tracking.
- Trust is critical for all organizations, including commercial ones, as demonstrated by a bank's rapid decline from most to least respected due to trust mismanagement.
- Every organization operates within an **enterprise story** defined by vision and values, requiring architectures to monitor non-monetary profits applicable to all enterprise types.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Identify core values**: Start with the enterprise story (e.g., TED's "ideas worth spreading") to list values like trust, reliability, environmental effectiveness, and financial probity that drive the organization's profit.
- **Model value flows with Enterprise Canvas**:
  1. Map value flows and transformations across services, avoiding reduction to money alone.
  2. Measure value effectiveness at each transform point.
  3. Track via pervasive services: build awareness (e.g., training), capability (e.g., policies), runtime enactment (e.g., checks), and monitor outcomes (e.g., metrics).
- **Implement monitoring architecture**: Define deliberate monitoring for each value through services like health/safety or security, ensuring proof of trust for models like self-insurance.
- Apply to any organization: Distinguish enterprise (vision/values-driven) from organization (execution), exchanging values horizontally while aligning vertically to enterprise aims.[2]

## Quotes
- "Every organization is for profit... what are the forms of value that we need to track especially when the money is secondary to the drivers for the organization."
- "A conventional money based organization transfers every form of value into money and ignores everything else this is not a good idea."
- "We need ways to monitor we need to measure at each step what the values are what the effective value of that value is at each point in the transform."
- "Pervasive services... build awareness this value is important build capability to actually enact that value at runtime make sure that it is enacted at runtime and then monitor what the effects are."
