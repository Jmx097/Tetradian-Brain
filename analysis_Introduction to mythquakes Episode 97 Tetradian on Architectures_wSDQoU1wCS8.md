# Analysis: Introduction to mythquakes: Episode 97, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
This video introduces the concept of **mythquakes** as collisions between untested assumptions (myths) and reality, analogous to earthquakes, with varying scales based on the number of lives affected. The speaker emphasizes preparing for mythquakes in enterprise architecture by practicing on small ones to handle larger disruptions, such as those from pandemics challenging just-in-time logistics and manufacturing myths. It previews a series exploring mythquakes' relevance to architects.

## Key Takeaways
- A **myth** is an untested or unverified assumption that underpins daily life and expectations of stability.
- A **mythquake** occurs when a myth conflicts with reality, ranging from minor (e.g., business-level affecting 10,000 people, mythquake 4) to severe (e.g., pandemic as mythquake 7-9).
- Mythquakes are not inherently negative—like earthquakes, they can bring positive change or "fun" if handled well, but require proactive engagement rather than denial.
- Enterprise architecture deals constantly with potential or actual mythquakes, as all change involves testing assumptions.
- Preparation involves practicing on small mythquakes to ready for big ones, using a scale akin to Richter (energy) or Mercalli (impact), measured in powers of 10 by lives affected.
- Examples include assumptions of indefinite pandemic-free operations, flawless just-in-time supply chains, and safe concentration of manufacturing in one country.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Examine assumptions (myths) at every level of operation to anticipate mythquakes.
- Practice responding to **small mythquakes** in business or personal contexts to build readiness for larger-scale events.
- Apply the **mythquake scale**: Rate by powers of 10 in lives affected (e.g., mythquake 4 for ~10,000 people) to assess severity.
- In enterprise architecture, treat every change initiative as a potential mythquake test—analyze myths upfront and work with conflicts rather than avoiding them.
- Upcoming episodes will detail mythquake impacts on enterprise architects, suggesting a series-based learning path.

## Quotes
- "A myth is an untested or unverified assumption and a myth quake occurs when we collide when that myth collides with reality."
- "Myth quakes in various levels depending on how many lives they affect so what we're dealing with right now is a myth quake 7 or rising rapidly to a myth quake 9."
- "We need to practice on the small myth quakes in order to be ready for the big ones."
- "The crucial point is to work with myth quakes rather than pretending that they don't exist."
- "In the next episode I'll look at how that affects what we do as Enterprise architects."
