in this episode I want to look at layering and interweaving how things layer and into weave through each other inner within an enterprise so for this example I'll use the enterprise of a town so what are the services that make up a town a town is an enterprise of enterprises everything is a service so what are those services what do they each do how do they intersect how does it all make it work when layer upon layer of services some are below ground some above how do they connect with each other how does that all work so IT the classical focus of Enterprise Architecture it's just one service amongst a vast number of others look around a town to see how many there really are the summon services are below ground water in this case telecoms over here what happens we can't just leave them as fit and forget because if they forget about them they'll fall apart over time different shops provide different services within the enterprise of a town each of them an enterprise all sorts of different usages changing moving over time this old 1830s fire service building was a private company until people realized that they had a huge incentive to make things worse then you have all the services that move through like buses and cars they all have to weave through a town we've got service and other services of delivery here deliver ruth at the food providers look at all the meeting places look at all the intersections of things what happens if you have scarcity in this case scarcity of parking spaces how do you allocate shared resources in a way that actually works for everyone how do you manage all of that well how do you deal with when new services have to cut across an old one in this case the new road cutting across the old road that's been there since Roman times how do you make it all work how do they get the services to interweave through each other without disrupting one other and buildings change things change in this example this used to be a chemist as you can see from the sign in the middle of the screen but used to be part of the boots chain which ran a light large public library in the upper upper floor but now it's just a betting shop how do things change over time an architecture is often suffered shows signs of an old technology in stones here a height protect the wall from 19th century wagon wheels that's the reason also why the downpipe is inset into the wall so that it won't be scraped off and often we describe things by what they used to be this old building used to be the post office and people refer to it as the post office even though it isn't there anymore so what happens in your organization how much do people refer to things by what they used to be rather than what they are now leave then you've got services that are forgotten and abandoned this old cinema in the middle of the screen has been there for 30 years abandoned unused - replaced by another multi-seat cinema but what happens when you've got a service that's sitting there doing nothing an old legacy that is just taking up space to me this is one of the best illustrations of layering and interweaving lintel weaving particularly over time right here we've got the old the current main road coming in past the town this bridge itself is also a main road it's the National Cycle Way route number one the Great North Road down below against the water the roadway there are all the signs of the regiments based in the town Sepideh gash garrison town for over a thousand years think of these in terms of services always an affront is the pub called the hole in the wall the reason why is because it's in a hole in the wall the Roman wall updated in medieval times has been providing the service of protecting the town for all of that period so the pub provides its services - and the Gateway provides control a service of controlled access no longer necessarily required in these days we hope but it's still there so the Gateway is still largely intact after 2000 almost 2000 years we have other services too and litter road signs looking around here there's the gateway the guard way the pub was built in 1650 s behind it we've got the Victorian water tower jumbo which is no longer in use the services no longer required and behind again the Mercury Theatre built in the 1960s still in youssef currently under repair as can be seen through the Gateway and we have signage like in this case looking at the town looking at the history all of these are history but all of these represent services either in use at the time and still often in use now all of these services interweaving layering interconnecting through time and through the present time so that's a real example of how layering and interweaving of services occurs in a large enterprise thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
