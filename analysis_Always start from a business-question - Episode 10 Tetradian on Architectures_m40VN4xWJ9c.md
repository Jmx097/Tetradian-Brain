# Analysis: Always start from a business-question - Episode 10, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video emphasizes that enterprise architecture must always begin with a specific business question or issue to deliver real value, rather than being done for its own sake. It highlights mapping dependencies between capabilities, processes, and systems to ensure changes make things work better together on purpose. This approach addresses commercial concerns like profit and efficiency or public sector goals like inclusive citizen services.

## Key Takeaways
- Start enterprise architecture from distinct **business questions** or issues, such as profit, productivity, efficiency in commercial settings, or reducing confusion and serving all citizens in government.
- Business issues arise because something is changing or needs to change in **how things work together**, requiring analysis of interdependencies among capabilities, operational functions, processes, and core systems.
- Architecture delivers value by focusing on making **moving parts interweave and work better on purpose**, paired with business concerns—the answer often is "it depends" on these dynamics.
- Avoid architecture for its own sake; use it to support people needing things to function more effectively together.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Identify business questions**: Ask in your environment, "What are the business issues?"—e.g., profit/productivity in commercial contexts or citizen service inclusivity in government.
- **Map dependencies**: Once capabilities and operational functions are understood, analyze how they depend on and link together, including how many business processes or core systems are involved in a transformation.
- **Assess changes**: For any business model change, evaluate how all moving parts must adjust to interweave effectively, then target changes to improve purposeful collaboration.
- Pair this with business questions to ensure architecture drives tangible value.
