in this episode I'd like to look at opportunity and risk and how we need to treat them as a symmetric pairs flip sides of each other for example most companies I know will run a risk register in fact they're often required to but very few I've come across run an opportunity register and if they do they don't link it to the to the risk register but there are symmetric pair it's like unit yang opposite sides of each other so for example when we look at a digital transformation it's an opportunity but there are always risks associated with digital transformation there's a risk around disruption to services there's a risk of cannibalization of existing services there are very real risks that it simply won't work or that it will eat up resources that we could use more usefully elsewhere there are always risks associated with an opportunity likewise when we look at a risk such as privacy for example the the private use of data a lot of people are very worried right now about GDP are the generalized data protection regulation and similar regulations that are coming up which will really change a lot of organizations in fact change a lot of business models but we need to look at it also as an opportunity it's one example of a value story of a values model of values concern if we sort this one out then we can deal with other value concerns such as quality security financial probity business ethics and so on it gives us a means to work with those things those themes and to work cleanly with them by understanding them that there are new opportunities that arise from each of the risks we always work with them as a symmetric pair as a pair and not as something separate from each other the way we do this is we start from vision and values what is the story here what does the story tell us the enterprise story what does it tell us about what our options are and how we can interact with the world that's why I like using the term option to describe opportunity risk as a pair because they always come together if we do it that way we get a much better chance of understanding what's going on and getting the best value I do each item we work with
