in a previous video we introduced the framework called scan which is a very simple way to make sense help us make sense of complexity it's just two axes relative to our given now how much time we have before and after and also the extent to which it's certain or uncertain predictable or unpredictable same or unique and we've in that previous videos or in previous videos we've talked about a real boundary which we might call the inverse Einstein boundary about if we do the same thing we'll get the same result if we do different things we will get we can get the same result if we do the same things we can get the same result if we do the same things we may get different results or we may need to do different things to get the same effective result I did the other axis what we have is a transition point between decision between the time to make sense versus the time we've got to decide between time to think and no time to think so we can give these although we've used labels before of calculated or complicated simple or rule-based ambiguous or pattern based and not known nothing's the same we have no time to think about it and it's inherently uncertain we can give these labels or descriptors kind of rolls if you like so on the one side this one we have to do things on belief we don't have time for anything else so this is the believer it's a roll it's not a person it's a roll here we can talk about the scientist someone who is calculating what's going on but probably doesn't reach the real world very much it's not dealing with real time on the other side dealing with uncertainty we've got the technologist the engineer the phrase it depends comes to mind what's down here we have the artist and there's a nice analogy here where we can describe reality as being like a swamp the artist runs like heck the catch is that you can't really come back you get lots of experiences but you can't really come back you can't describe how you got there the believer stays in exactly one place and follows the rules these are the answers that are previously set we will do what we know that gets us results fast but it can't deal with variation or variance or another what we have is the scientists who've been very clever they've woven a platform they've woven up a platform between these individuals of belief to build a whole structure and finally we have the technologists who can was like spreading of their weight on swamp shoes they can travel around and rest for a while so that they don't sink so the driver here is effectively truth versus value between each of these there are edges so this one we might describe as the edge of innovation an artist comes up with an idea and bat it bounces backwards and forwards between experiment new idea experiment new idea but we're always dealing with the uncertain we can't really produce things very much so that's the edge of innovation this one is the edge of uncertainty where again we bounce backwards and forwards the job of those two is to reduce uncertainty is to identify what has to remain complex and will always remain uncertainty versus things that extract out of it the things that can be made more certain so that's an edge of uncertainty here we have more bouncing backwards and forth back and forth across the edge of action and here is what we might call the edge of panic where the believer gets launched into they're not known now there's an interesting thing that happens here because if we look at how this works in real life we have if you look at how science develops we have idea the new idea arises in the not known the only place where new ideas can arrive and can arise is from the not known from there we build a hypothesis we then test that refine that to build a theory and from there we derive what we think of as scientific law or some kind of law so there's a very strong loop or strong a strong link that goes from there to there the flow is in this direction but there's a catch if we think of it as a development loop it should go back to new ideas again but instead what we often have is what we might describe as the heresy barrier the fear of difference the fear of change and we build a solid wall against any air for seeing anything new this is the heresy barrier and in every organization every context wherever there's a rule that is being followed and is treated as a ver truth we will have problems with a heresy barrier so one of our tasks in making sense of complexity and uncertainty in dealing with all of these transitions is to face that barrier otherwise we will never be able to get any innovation working at all so there's a nice way of describing ways of looking at and the kinds of thinking the modes of thinking that we need how we transition between them but also to be aware of getting stuck in any one of these positions and particularly that one of the heresy barrier so scan is really useful for helping us make sense of these kind of transitions the the changes in modes of thinking that we need to make something happen it's a very useful tool for this kind of purpose thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't
