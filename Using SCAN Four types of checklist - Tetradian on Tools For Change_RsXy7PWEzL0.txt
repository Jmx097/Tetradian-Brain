this time we'll use the scan framework on complexity to look at a slightly different issue about checklists about why there are four fundamentally different type of checklists that we need to have for any kind of work now all checklists happen or used below the line when we're in the action and we have no time to think we can't stop to do the action to do the thinking about something that's what we need checklists forests guidance in the midst of action now at the simplest possible level we have good old work instructions these are supposed to be dealing with the world of certainty these are step by step and as long as things stay the same they should always work the same way so these are coming from the world of certainty the planning the plan gives us that but the plan also needs to give us other types of checklist now the crucial point here is that there's another concern that we have that's the boundary of effective certainty on this side we expect things to stay the same or same enough we've got business rules enough to cover it on this side we need to do different things to get the same results or we're doing the same thing they give us different results well the world's just changed on us anyway so as we get closer to anything that gives us uncertainty or we want to reduce risk that's what we need what's known as a checklist for example free takeoff the free takeoff checklist our whole point is we go through a list of things that may not necessarily be step-by-step but we do need to do them to reduce the risk of something happening in mid-flight we want to make sure we've got enough fuel we want to make sure we've got pressure in the tires we want to make sure that the ailerons and other controls move freely those are part of our free takeoff checklist pre landing checklist the same again we've got time to do it it's sort of coming in from it's still about we've still got some time to spare on the other side we need another kind of checklist which is the emergency checklist which is the help we need when things have already gone wrong we're no longer at risk we are in the middle of something having gone wrong now these kind of checklists are quite different for example for an aircraft with the engine out checklist might well have an instruction fly the airplane because one of the things that people forget in a panic this being the edge of panic one of the things that people forget is that if the aircraft goes below a certain speed it ceases to be an aircraft and becomes a brick so we have to keep aware of the total and that's what that type of checklist is for and finally there's a quite different kind of checklist when we literally have no idea what's going on that's the checklist that we would use in complete panic where we have no idea and that's where principles and values come in because as we flail around for anything and anything and nothing might be true principles and values give us some kind of anchor with which we can work so the planning for these comes from the ambiguous world knowing what goes wrong and these are about deep uncertainty and help us when we don't know what's going on they give us some kind of anchor so there's four fundamentally different types of checklist the work instruction the ordinary pre takeoff checklist pre action checklist to reduce risk there's the emergency checklist when we're in a sort of known situation and principles and values when we have no idea what's going on at all so scan helps us map out on this axis what kind of checklists we need and we need all of them or we may need all of them for any kind of action so if we don't have principles and values we will not be able to hold on I sort out what's happening with deep uncertainty if we don't have emergency checklists we may not be able to recover from an emergency so we need these as a set for any kind of action that's where scan can help us map these issues out thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
