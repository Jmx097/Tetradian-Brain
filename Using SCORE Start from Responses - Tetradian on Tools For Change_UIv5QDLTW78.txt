in this series we're exploring how to use the score frame a very simple framework from helping make sense of and finding insights about just about any issue particularly strategic ones I've got it here scrawled out as if done on a whiteboard or up or I and in a notebook because it's the kind of thing that you'd scribble out rather than use heavily printed forms we've got the strength the capabilities that we're going to work with the challenges the things that we don't have all that we need to work on the options that the opportunities and risks that we see in the outside world and the responses that we go whether we have a have or need to get from the outside world the reactions the raging x' the the rewards the really useful stuff the information that we're going to need and in the middle bridging between all of these between the inside world and the outside world we have effectiveness which is really our success criteria in the broadest sense of the term how we keep track to our promise to the enterprise as a whole so one of the questions we get asked a lot is where do you start well we start from whatever question that we've got coming in towards us typically we're going to have a set of criteria that are relevant to the overall space that we collect from our visioning about the enterprise our understanding of what the enterprise is and the promises that we're making so in this case we've got a a question they were going to explore of here's a list of new features requests from promises where do we start well if we look at it they're a list from customers straight away that says that their responses we're going to start over here and the other thing that this tells us if it's new feature requests then by definition it's things that we don't have so we've been mediately built a trial in this case we're going to need some new features as requested and the question is which ones what are we going to do what are our options are opportunities which features well there's two ways we can look at this one one of them is that we would say we're going to look at what we'll build on our exists strengths what do we already have because that will help us deal with issues around the integrity of the platform and maintainability if a new feature matches those then that's going to help a lot we're also going to see which features is it going to be difficult to build how much effort will it take to build this new feature and also will it be seen as high value how many customers will value it to what extent will they kept value it how much will they tell others that our product does this and other the other people's doesn't what value will they put on this new feature as a result of the work of adding it to that to that so for each of these again which features we're looking at the opportunity that each represents particularly in terms of how it effects each of these again but also what risk does that each one represents is it too much effort is it too much is it too much effort to build will it be seen as high value now if we're going to neat that it's going to be seen as high value we're going to have to request information in order to get it back in order to assess that we need to be able to test what value it would have and what value match our expectation of what it is with the real world's response the integrity of the platform and so on is mainly about us so we're going to look at the risks in terms of the maintainability which will build on our strengths what we don't want is a new feature that's going to break something if it's going to build the integrity of the platform add a whole new area that we can then treat as a base for a whole load of other new features or new possibilities and for each of these new features we're going to look at what possibilities does this provide us each one of these is going to take us back over here again so we can use this frame as a checklist to keep King at what does each one of these reply what can we build on how come what return will be our return on effort again return on effort it means that we've got a search for the problem will return on that effort we need the information about that too so this is an example of how you can use score to start from what is actually a response from people and then build outwards to guide our decision-making in our exploration and what this implies thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
