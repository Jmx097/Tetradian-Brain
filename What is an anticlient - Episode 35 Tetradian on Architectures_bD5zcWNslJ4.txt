my colleague Jack Martin leaf asked me to describe the term NT client an anti client is someone who feels betrayed by the organization in some way it's very important to understand this is not the same as competitor the competitor is someone who is competing in the same space but an anti client is often someone who's been a client and feels betrayed so if you think of the story of the enterprise that are talked about in episode 34 then as far as the anti client is concerned there has been a betrayal of the story they object to how the organization is operating within the story so for example if your business is about oil exploration in the Amazon then you're definitely going to get anti clients people who object to how you are operating within the story of the Amazon the environmentalists for example would be very upset they're not clients they are objecting to your the way you operate the other one is that you can betray a client an existing client by the way that you betray the story the classic example here is one called United breaks guitars there's a singer-songwriter who and it was band were traveling from Canada through the US by United Airlines and at Chicago O'Hare the guitars were broken in transit by bad baggage handling so United tried to push them off and push them off and push them off they're trying to avoid covering the cost of the repair for over a year but eventually he said well if it was a filmmaker might write a documentary about this but I'm a singer/songwriter what can I do I know I can write a song so he wrote a song with a happy little ditty called United breaks guitars and he put it up on YouTube and he had had three hits before he went to bed and he was quite happy three days later it was at 300,000 hits and United realized they had a major problem on their hands in effect - when I first saw it was all well well over a million and I'm in Britain it was in Canada it's currently now at about 10 15 maybe even 20 thousand views huge huge numbers so to save themselves about five hundred dollars United actually cost themselves a direct cost of something like twenty million dollars aunty clients can cause enormous damage in the days of social media but so we need to take them seriously but the other way instead of thinking of them as a risk we can think of them as an opportunity so Walmart for example the big big firm the big retailer for a long time had been pestered by environment environmentalists and by sustainability activists who said their business model was not sustainable and suddenly someone on the board of Walmart realized and said hang on if then they're telling us that we don't have a sustainable business model if we don't have a sustainable business model we don't have a business and so they turned around and engage directly with certain of the sustainability activists to create a whole new approach to however handle their supply chains there's a website called Walmart sustainability dot-com which is the based website for their supply chain they hold their suppliers so they're working with people who had been their anti clients in order to create something that actually benefits both parties so you can treat anta clients as a risk or as an opportunity it's up to you but the most dangerous mistake of all is to ignore them now it's not just any clients you can also have anti employees people who feel betrayed who work for the organization but feel betrayed by it or let down by it or uninvolved this is on the one side where you get whistleblowers who warn that there are problems similar to the sustainability activists but you also get issues like presenteeism where the person is physically present but it's just not really doing anything it's not committed to the work and where the productivity and effectiveness is very very low a lot of organizations are in that kind of problem in that kind of pitch so we need to take this seriously and we need to take it seriously in a way that we can make them visible and work with our anti clients and also our anti employees in order to make the organization work
