this is the first and a set of four videos about myth quakes I've covered the subject a bit more earlier on but this is a more in-depth view and it's actually I recorded these several months back maybe June or July of last year but I held them back because I was wanted to hold them back until I had more of the book that relates to them ready which ended up being held up for quite a while but one thing we need to I need to emphasize is that when we talk about myth quakes it's not an event that's the mythic quake so for example right now it's not the pandemic that's the myth quake what it actually is is that a myth is an untested or I'm a verified assumption and a myth quake occurs when we collide when that myth collides with reality department when we scale different myths myth and myth quakes in various levels depending on how many lives they affect so what we're dealing with right now is a myth quake 7 or rising rapidly to a myth quake 9 we have to take it very seriously indeed but we do that by looking at the small earthquakes but here in this particular case the myths that were looking at were the idea that we could continue indefinitely that the never would be a pandemic that just-in-time logistics just-in-time manufacturing would be always be fine that that never be a problem with having all manufacture for some key item moved and concentrated just in one country and then no longer be able to ship or move things for to and from that country so when myth quake is a very important concept we need to look at our myths at every possible level that's what this series of videos is about in the next series of videos I want to talk about an idea called myth quake a new concept about how to understand change a myth is an untested or unverified assumption and most of us operate on assumptions about pretty much everything everyday life is based on assumptions that things will stay the same or do what we expect a myth quake occurs when our myth conflicts with reality and there are different levels of myth quake so for enterprise architecture this is important because almost every kind of change in fact yeah every kind of change is going to be about potential or actual myth quakes we're dealing with myth quakes all of the time there's an analogy here with earthquakes which I'll come back to later therefore gives the idea that a myth quake is always bad but in the same way that earthquakes can actually be quite fun if you don't in any way that's dangerous being in a space where the world is dancing is actually quite fun in the same sense myth quakes can be good as well as bad there can be comedy as well as tragedy the crucial point is to work with myth quakes rather than pretending that they don't exist we can't hide from myth quakes reality Department will force us on any force of myth quake on us anyway whenever our myth chol it conflicts with reality but we need to practice on the small myth quakes in order to be ready for the big ones and the point that concerns me particularly is there are some very very very big ones that are coming our way listen to me understand just how severe weak where these can be there's a useful scale that we can apply if you like a myth quake scale looks somewhat equivalent to the earthquake scales of Richter about energy and McCallie about impact or damage a myth quake scale is in we can number them in powers of 10 in terms of the number of lives that can be affected by a single myth quake so a typical myth quake that we might deal with in business is a myth quake 4 it might affect 10,000 people I call it a myth quake scale because I'd hesitate to call it a grave scale because it unfortunately could be all too literally true so a myth quake is an untether a myth is an untested or unverified assumption a myth quake occurs whenever a myth conflicts with reality in the next episode I'll look at how that affects what we do as Enterprise architects
