in this video I want to explore a model called Enterprise canvas which is a checklist for making sense of services in fact we treat everything as a service in enterprise canvas so the starting idea is that for anything there is a atten whenever we want to do anything there is a tension between what we have the realized ends as opposed to what we want to get towards which is our desired ends and to make that happen we have some means we need some means to make that happen which we might call a service but that's the means by which something can happen that's a service we're creating a service for ourselves we're serving our needs now in try reaching towards making our needs happen we may call on someone else we might call a supplier classically and likewise when we're working towards our ends we might be able to help someone else that's what we would call a customer and you'll notice that it's completely symmetric a customer who may have a customer a supplier may have a supplier so it's working in a completely consistent way now in the same way that we have our desired ends our supplier has their own desired ends they're reaching towards their own ends as well and the same is true for our customer and one of the things that makes it work is that there is some kind of connection between what we're reaching towards and what our customer is reaching towards are the same from the supplier side they're not necessarily the same desired ends but there will be some relationship between them usually a connection of values vision and values are shared in some way so to make sense of our own services and service relationships we need to look at what those value as connections are this is a flow of value we're creating value in some way for someone else at the same time as building towards making ours so it's a flow of value that continues onward in both directions look what we look at this we can start saying well the stuff that we happen that we need to do before we create value that's for example the value proposition is a classic example of that how we propose to deliver value some people describe value proposition as being a fancy name for your services or products well no because it's connecting the value to the values connecting to the story then it makes it up so and we also have stuff that follows after so for example that's what we might call value governance we'll come back to that in a moment but we then have other supplier facing services services that are facing the stuff coming in and services that are facing the customer side stuff going out so there are interactions so when we look at the supplier they're actually the same as well they have their own value proposition their own fairly production the the value creation and the same is true on the customer side so again it's completely symmetrical it's just everything is a service which we view in the same way so there are interactions that happen before a service delivery which very much go both ways we are this is for example procurement and that's marketing building a sales relationship there's a main flow that happens during the transaction and there's a kind of flow that typically happens afterwards such as in a commercial environment you get paid or you pay your supplier so another video that we have on this set is about the service cycle about what happens during these interactions there's a connecting to the overall purpose connecting to a conversation connecting to building relationships run the actual transaction and then unpacking it all the way back so that we make sure we've connected katana completion in relation to the story so there's an overall flow there now between each of these services whenever there is a boundary there is going to be some kind of product it's mark it denotes the boundary so for example we're passing a product through here to use in our service we're passing products around brochures and so on we're passing bills and so on and bills invoices and payments are going through there so these are products which are static things as opposed to services which are activities so this side is out for the outgoing facing this is the incoming facing and you can see it's exactly the same but it also means that each of these is a service in its own right so we can look at these as being a service which has if it's a service it has the same structure internally as well there are services that are coming in their interactions that are going both ways there it's providing services that's coming back in so it's fractal in that sense exactly the same patterns happens exactly the same way every service contains other services in fact even within here there's going to be services within services which is what we talk and call about a decomposition of services or an aggregation as it comes together so we can look at every interaction every service in exactly the same way regardless of scope scale content or context it provides us with a completely consistent way of making sense of service relationships so that's the core of enterprise canvas in the next video we'll look at how governance happens how management happens how weather the relationships are for example with investors and beneficiaries so this is the core of everything seen as a service it provides a checklist that we can make sense of what's going on we look for what are the realized ends the desired ends what are the connections of you values that connect us to our suppliers and customers what are the products that are going to occur at the boundaries what are the means by which we deliver value by which we deliver value to others or bring in value from others so it's a simple checklist that we can use for any type of service and say the next part we'll look at this in more detail the netting how the actual governance and coordination happens but that's for something for the next video for here we've just got this overall checklist about how everything works together thanks for watching do look at the youtube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us
