in the last episode we talked about the challenge of simple yet not simplistic about working with complexity and building complexity from small simple components yet not dumbing it down to the point where it becomes unusable to simplistic to make sense so in our own work for change mapping the method we called five elements or sometimes seaspar contains contexts scope plan action review we needed a method that would work the same way everywhere any scope any scale any content any context we needed to link all of the different tools together we needed to use the kind of UNIX type approach where rather than in UNIX where everything is a file in CCR everything is a tool everything is a plug in change mapping everything is a plug in tool so we needed to be able to link tools together to do all the detail work while the basic approach always remained exactly the same so the first challenge was apply the method to its own design we needed to build what is this context what we're trying to do what is the scope what is the plan for action what is the action itself what how can we review this what are the results of many reviews to tell us what to do next want to change we had call criteria which came from the context of space about wanting it to make it human wanting to make it usable not just by specialists but by anyone by the early majority a group and more we needed again success criteria coming again from the context space about the need to have it understandable need to have it used in practice and also using it ourselves in practice to do this kind of work there was an iterative process of development a lot of visuals a lot of metaphor using multiple metaphors and focusing on metaphor rather than text making it to make it accessible we also wanted to use it to surface to bring to the surface any hidden assumptions that might exist and we needed to build it as a loop so that we could do real-world tests review rethink redesign and loop background connecting always back to the original purpose of a method that works exactly the same way at the core of itself so that there's only one area to learn one basic approach to learn that applies everywhere so we were using that on itself to do the development process thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
