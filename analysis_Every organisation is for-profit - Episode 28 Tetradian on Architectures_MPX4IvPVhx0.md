# Analysis: Every organisation is 'for-profit' - Episode 28, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video challenges the traditional for-profit vs. not-for-profit distinction, arguing that every organization pursues profit when profit is redefined beyond money to include non-monetary values like trust and satisfaction. It critiques money-centrism in business architecture, akin to IT-centrism in enterprise architecture, and emphasizes distinguishing between price, value, worth, and cost to better assess organizational success.

## Key Takeaways
- Every organization is inherently **for-profit**, but profit must encompass diverse forms of value, not just monetary gains.
- Business architecture suffers from **money-centrism**, a flawed focus on financial metrics that overlooks non-convertible values like trust and satisfaction.
- Key distinctions: **value** (services delivered, e.g., added house features over time), **worth** (personal meaning, e.g., house vs. home), **cost** (total effort including non-monetary inputs), and **price** (monetary evaluation, often unreliable due to irreversible transformations).
- Framing everything in monetary terms destroys non-financial values; instead, focus on the values, services, worth, and costs that drive true profit.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Rethink profit by identifying and prioritizing **non-monetary values** (e.g., trust, satisfaction) alongside financial ones in organizational strategy.
- Analyze assets using the value-worth-cost-price framework: assess services delivered (value), personal/organizational meaning (worth), total effort invested (cost), and monetary tag (price) to avoid over-relying on price.
- In architecture practices, shift from money-centric models to holistic ones that measure profit in terms of needed value production, enabling better decision-making for all organization types.

## Quotes
- "Actually every organisation is for profit."
- "There are many forms of value and not all of them can or should be framed or converted to monetary form for example look at trust look at satisfaction those are things that can't be converted to monetary form or if we do we usually destroy them."
- "Price is an almost meaningless term because it's made up of all sorts of non-trans transferable not reversible transforms so trying to build everything on money and price is not actually a good idea."
- "What we need to do is get better at producing the profit that we need."
