in the previous video on scan we looked at how the whole thing works how all the different parts work together how it's built from really a very simple relationship between time and complexity or uncertainty what I want to do this time is to simplify it right down to just those two elements the time before before and after something happens and the level of uncertainty and what we can do about that uncertainty so this one's based on a fairly straightforward example of an operation a surgical operation imagine someone's going for an operation known on a cancer let's say so it's a slightly concerning issue but let's have a look at how all the elements in that stack together so if we draw that simple axis from of time coming through to and now and then onwards into what will become after who will become the after so we're going from before to the now and then the after and in the opposite direction we've got a scale of uncertainty or complexity all the way out to complete uncertainty we have no idea what's going on so from certain to uncertain I will start up here with the very beginning point of the of the whole thing which is if this is if the now is going to be the moment of being within the operation itself then here is when the patient first comes in and the first thing we want to capture is patient identity and that's important because everything else comes from that you don't want to do the operation on the wrong person you don't want to do the wrong operation on that person you've got to pin everything onto that so that's really an absolutely core item we've got to be certain about that now as time goes on just after straight after we've brought that person into the hospital the next thing we want to check is patient condition and we note that that's going to be changing all the way through we're going to be concerned about that that's likely to go to being more or less certain over time and we're also going to have to be concerned about what the family are doing we're going to although the patient is the person were working on there are other stakeholders in this case there's a family and we need to watch that that's not something we can control at all and what for that we're definitely going to need someone like say a chaplain to help us keep track of what's going on whereas something for the patient identity the first thing we're likely to do is print a barcode bracelet good clip that on in a way that it's not going to come off then having got that sorted out we want to pin down a theater booking we want to have the the operating theater booked that's another crucial thing because we need to know where it's going to happen if you like that's who this is where and this is related to what this is a issue that we want to be able to bring more say it more certain than it is at the moment next thing on this if we've got the theater booking and the patient condition tracked we now want to find out what to develop a surgery plan and that's going to be contending on the patient condition there's a dependent relationship here as also yeah given the surgery plan we're now going to need an equipment plan that too is a dependency and we need to be very clear about those we can't go into the theater if we haven't got the right equipment otherwise we're going to be putting the patient at risk so we need to be certain about this we know these are uncertain we know that we don't have a clue what's going to happen here because one of the things that's liked it happen is we're likely to get pre operation complications and again we really want to be able to pull those over as much as we can to make those more sense more certain but we know that we can't know beforehand we also got to check the surgical staff availability who's going to be available to do it because that can vary we've got rosters but it's a known unknown as we get closer towards doing the operation of the day of them the morning of the operation we're going to double verify the patient's identity we've got the patient on the gurney we now need to verify that this is the verify the patient it's the right one and we've verified not just the patient identity and action so if it moves an operation on a leg we might literally draw on that leg and action this must be known before we go into the into the surgery and the next thing we're going to need to verify usually with the checklist is the consumables that we're going to use we're going to need the right consumables with a margin for error like blood packs and so on because what we don't want to have happen is though suddenly going uncertain on us we need to keep track of what's going on now another booby trap that can happen at the very last moment we've got the patient ready we've got the prescient under anaesthetic and then suddenly we've got a traffic emergency and everything well it's all hands down to go and do an emergency so every theater gets booked in a hurry [Music] and we have to boot our patient out of the theater because someone else has an even higher priority that our patient does now that's another known unknown we know it's a risk we need a protocol in place to handle it so it's we need to be clear what the safe last moment is before we can actually go into theater on when we close the theater and say you can't come in so along with that there's all kinds of emergency actions that might be needed as we go into the operation itself things can go wrong and we don't know beforehand what they're going to be a surgeon might Nick Nick the patient's aorta while trying to cut out a liver cancer for example that means you've got very serious emergency action we also might have the family trying to barge in at the last moment having realized it's a life-threatening injury a life-threatening operation and therefore we're going to need not so much a chaplain here we're going to need security staff to stop them barging in and as we go through the now of the operation one thing that we're going to be building up all the time is action records because we're going to need those to learn form from the future so what we're doing is we're trying to move things around trying to make things more certain build things that will help us anchor certainty in some way or another but we can also see an important point here about we can divide this quite simply not just in terms of certainty but the tools we can use for certainty hence for example here we want IT this is very much something that we want IT to do the IT is going to be taking effectively doing the decision making they're very simple decisions in most cases about identity but they're essential decisions here we have protocols that deal with uncertainty and the role of IT is IT decision support not decision-making and over here this is going to depend entirely on human skill and the only role of IT is going to be real tight IT provides real-time info and that's it so this is a simple example of how to plot something out using those two axes it's a simple example of scan about the choices that we make that the kinds of tools that we can use and build for these kinds of purposes how we make all of this work dealing with uncertainty accepting uncertainty is an inherent fact of the context rather than pretending that everything can be locked into IT so we look at those again the quick summary a quick overview is that we've divided we mapped out in time and in terms of uncertainty to help us build an understanding of what's going on and we can partition it in terms of the tools that we can use of the kinds of decision-making that has to be done that's a useful role for scan thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and
