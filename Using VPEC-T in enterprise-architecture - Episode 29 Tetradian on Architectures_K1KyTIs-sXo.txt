this time Eric Weinstein asks about a framework called VPT which we found very useful for enterprise architecture VPT is a framework device developed by Nigel Greene and Carl bait which is just a set of lenses if you like to look into a context VPT stands from values policies event content and trust was recently folk developed in their work on the UK justice system as a whole enterprise particularly to deal with the relationships between stakeholders all of them had very different views on what was actually needed in the context one example was a clash between frontline police and prosecutors effect for the court the frontline police the one thing they wanted to do was get out on the street and catch the bad guys the one thing they didn't want to do was as they saw it waste their time doing the paperwork on the other side the prosecutors what they wanted and needed was the paperwork fully done otherwise the court the case might well be lost at court just on a technicality so they needed that the paperwork fully done all the eyes dotted the t's crossed everything exactly correct which is exactly what the police did not want now that you started to see what the different values were but could then start to look for a place where they met and in this case it was that both of them wanted the bad guys kept off the street so it became of interest to the police to do the paperwork and it became of interest to the court of the prosecutors that the police be supported in being out on the street as much as possible so redesign the way it works such that the police get all the information that they need with the minimum of time and the minimum of effort but it's fully cross-checked such that the prosecutors and get what they need these kind of clashes occurred all the way across the whole enterprise including the victim support system the courts themselves the police the the remand group which three people before they go to trial the detention group who are running the prison's themselves victim support group families support group offender support groups and so on they all had different views they all had to be brought together by looking at values policies event content and trust it becomes a way of understanding how all of these can be brought together to work together in a whole the real crucial central point here is actually trust how do we get each of the stakeholder groups to trust the other to give them what they themselves will need so everything that we do within that space needs to be about building maintaining creating supporting trust there's a sort of parallel with five elements if you're familiar with that where we go from purpose to people to process to to preparation to process to performance which is some similarity because as we leave purpose we want to know about values as we leave people we want to have policies that drive the preparation the trigger from going from preparation to process is some kind of event and we're collecting content and reviewing content inside performance but the difference now is that those are going round there are triggers to move to the next phase whereas VPT more properly as a set of lenses looking into the view of the space as a whole they related but they're not quite the same so it's important not to mix them up so petit is one of the values one of the policies what are the events what are the content and what supports trust for each of the stakeholders and stakeholder groups and then each of the stakeholders in relation to all of the others values policies event content trust a very useful filter a very useful framework to use an enterprise architecture
