how do we prove the value of enterprise architecture this is a question post by Sam Reddy who asked how really can we do it our KPIs or just metrics just enough in practice the answer is no what we really need is to prove particularly by showing how things do work better together and on purpose some real examples we had on this from Australia Post a couple of years back one of them was about REO the small blue projects that seem to have had no value on its own it was about information on what a mail truck contained when it left a mail depo so seem to have no value as a negative in this case it had been turned down twice but in the architecture team when we took this on we looked at it in terms of a whole bunch of other major projects that were going on at the time what about rostering what about work scheduling what about logistics utilization and so on we realized that if we put out in the middle and did a slight rework of how the other projects connected with each other suddenly that little valueless project and is something like several million dollars worth of value to these other projects by looking at how it worked as a whole now we had a small discretionary budget which allows us to change things around a bit to entice people to change their projects to work together but we were able to demonstrate how it worked together another one was what we called the functional business model this was a model of if actually capabilities if you like or functions and the most broad sense with three different tiers one of them the most abstract which is true for every company the second one which would be true for pretty with any kind of logistics company and the third was specific to this organization the third tier so we'd build this map about 250 capabilities as you'll see from the diagram and we put many overlays onto this in how information mapped to it how projects mapped to it activity-based costing act mapped to it we heard our proof because every single manager printed their their own copy and used it on their wall to describe how they fitted within the organization and to show their staff to show new people where they fitted where everyone else fitted how they communicated with everyone else when managers steal your own work in architecture you know that you've got value delivered
