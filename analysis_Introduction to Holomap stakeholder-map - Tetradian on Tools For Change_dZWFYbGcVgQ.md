# Analysis: Introduction to Holomap stakeholder-map - Tetradian on Tools For Change

## Executive Summary
The video introduces the Holomap as a visual tool for mapping stakeholders in an enterprise context, starting from the organization or a specific service and expanding outward through four layers: internal services, transactions, direct market interactions, and indirect influences. It emphasizes identifying stakeholders' roles, responsibilities, relationships, and potential impacts—defining a stakeholder as anyone who could direct a "sharp-pointed stake" toward the organization. Using simple minifigures, the presenter illustrates a comprehensive stakeholder ecosystem to make the concept tangible and actionable.

## Key Takeaways
- Stakeholders include anyone with potential influence, even indirectly, such as suppliers' suppliers, competitors, regulators, hackers, activists, and community families.
- Holomap uses concentric layers from the central organization/service: **internal services** (e.g., IT, facilities, accounts), **transactions** (supply chain, customers, prospects), **direct interactions** (market players like recruiters, journalists), and **indirect interactions** (infrastructure, government, observers).
- Internal services may be under direction but not full control, highlighting the need to distinguish authority from influence.
- The tool clarifies roles, relationships, responsibilities, and interactions, applicable to the whole enterprise or a single service as the center.
- Broadens beyond IT-centric views to encompass the full enterprise scope for better awareness of risks and opportunities.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Start with the center**: Position the organization or specific service (e.g., IT) as the core, represented by a simple figure like a manager.
- **Map internal layer**: Add internal services (IT, facilities, accounts, production, planning, engineering) around the center, noting relationships like IT-business tensions.
- **Expand to transactions**: Include supply chain (suppliers, suppliers' suppliers, customers, customers' customers, prospects) as the first outward ring.
- **Add direct interactions**: Place market stakeholders (competitors, regulators, recruiters, journalists, analysts, trainers) in the next ring.
- **Include indirect influences**: Map broader ecosystem players (infrastructure, families/communities, government, politics, activists, hackers, criminals, observers) in the outermost ring.
- **Visualize with minifigures**: Use simple icons to humanize the map, drawing lines for interactions and distinguishing control vs. direction.
- **Adapt for any service**: Reposition any service as the center and map outward similarly to focus analysis.
