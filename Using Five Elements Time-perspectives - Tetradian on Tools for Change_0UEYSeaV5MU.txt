in the last episode I talked about the very old Chinese model of five elements wood fire earth metal water there's a number of places where we've used that in a very practical way to solve real business problems one of the more interesting ones is called time perspectives each different part of the organization not only have different views onto the organization but often also has completely different views about time and what time scales are what happens this is a real workshop we did with them with a large Bank in fact to get them to understand this the role of strategy and how it fed down into into work and then the continual relearning from that process what we did was we split it up into five fred time frames that matched very well with chinese five elements the first of these are the wood if you like the springing up is all about the future but it's a far future there was fire which is very much about people time people have shift at random from far future too far past and back again it's one of the things that connects all the different time perspectives together and there's planning well the the earth the settling-down we saw a lot of time back scheduling this is about the near future about things that are going to happen quite soon but are not happening now then we've got the metal or stone man what's happening now what's happening now now now always in capital letters always an exclamation mark now but finally there's the kind of review that's settling out that thing's dissolving coming apart looking at the past and all we did was it was an exercise a workshop exercise which you might like to do yourself split up a group into five sub groups you need about 22 five people for this can do it with more but not much less than about 20 for each of these groups one of them is strategy another is HR another is planning or management if you like the kind of scheduling of stuff there's the production people and finally this the review that now the accounts that the follow up the all those kind of areas about you should have right so the strategy people with each of these groups we want them to be to describe each of the other groups and notice how we allow people to be rude and that is what how comes up so for example the strategy people will say well the HR people are crazy but at least they sometimes understand what the hell we're all about the near future yeah they just I think the sort of like us but they just don't have a grasp of how things are working production are bad they don't understand of a future at all they'd only focused on now the past well if they understood how they worked with us they might work but they've got a completely different perspective always looking backward then we cannot say the the HR people who are busy being rude about everyone else we've got the the managers saying that the the the strategy people just idea asked us they've got no idea how things happen in the real world the the HR are crazy but occasionally they give us people that can be useful the the production people they're all again they're all crazy everyone else is crazy because they don't hold the same perspectives as us the trick here is now you to everyone now move round one and notice how what the first thing that comes up and take all so take on the descriptions that they've been given about everyone else and the first thing that comes up is that's really unfair we're just doing our jobs so one of the things that comes up this is a song realization of just how much the different perspectives arise from the nature of the work itself but hence most of these clashes aren't people just being awkward or doing things to be awkward they're trying to do their work as best they can which clashes with us but everyone has to be working together as a whole in order for this to work so one of the things that happens that comes up out of this is first of all what happens if just one group dominates you end up with losing all the other time perspectives and everything that is needed from that and the other thing that happens is finally someone says who's holding the center who's keeping the balance and the answer in too many cases is no one that's why you need someone to do this with us so having got all of this information about the clash isn't natural that there needs to be someone to hold the center to hold the balance that all of these time perspectives are needed to get things right then the next thing we can do is start discussing what we can each do to reduce those clashes and respect that everyone's perspective is correct form their own view even if it isn't so far ours thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
