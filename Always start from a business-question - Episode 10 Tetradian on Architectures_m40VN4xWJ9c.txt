continuing the theme from last time about how do we deliver value one of the ways we can do this is to always start from a distinct business question so unload for example asked but we have to start from their business world of shoes the business worlds issues so which questions what our business issues for enterprise architecture what ask around ask in your environment what are the questions were the issues that people are facing through our business in a commercial environment it might be profit or productivity or efficiency in a in the government environment is how do we reduce confusion how do we service every type of citizen rather than only the easy ones these are real business questions these are revealed with business concerns so a real answer in fact is closer to one thing we talked about before which was it depends it depends how things work together it depends on how things work on purpose so whenever come across a business question or a business issue it's because something is changing or needs to change around how things work together whenever you change a business model for example all the moving parts have to move together in a different way well they may have to we look at this so Emma court for example asks how many business processes core systems would be involved with a given transformation or a given change once we've backed out I've got some understanding of what all the capabilities and of operational functions we have we can now look at how they depend on each other and linked together how they move how the moving parts need to interweave then what we need to change to make them work better so that focus on things work better together on purpose is always a really useful one particularly when we pair it with any given business question so we always start with a business question in order to learn to deliver business value that's really the focus of the architecture we don't do our key texture for its own sake we're doing it because it delivers useful value to people who need that to happen who need things to work together better and on purpose
