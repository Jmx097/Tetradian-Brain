who day Merlin asks how did we get here what's the history of enterprise architecture and what can we learn from that history well the most useful sequence to me about the history of what's called Enterprise Architecture came from Donna Brad Amaya way back in 2005 he talks about ITA IT architecture particularly infrastructure architecture the architecture of the Internet and the enterprise's IT infrastructure and that's what we got particularly in frameworks like tow up to TOGAF seven version tiger version seven then we started getting into what Brett am I called a Witter enterprise wide IT architecture which is what we got up to about TOGAF eight the problem then came that people confused enterprise-wide IT architecture and they simplified it down to enterprise architecture which causes a lot of problems as we'll see later then by a version by token version 8.1 we got Enterprise our wide IT architecture with what they called business architecture which unfortunately wasn't the architecture of the business but simply a summary of anything not IT that might affect our team it's only much later so TOGAF particularly continued on with version 9 9 and version 9.1 still with essentially the same model so the rushman TOGAF we have now doesn't really cover anything other than a slightly better example or understanding of how business affects IT but what we needed right from the start in our work in Australia Post and elsewhere was what we called whole enterprise architecture the literal the architecture of the enterprise where the term Enterprise relates not just to scale but to the actual scope and it's an enterprise that extends beyond the organization in effect it's a story that holds everyone together when we sons made that understanding we looked at some precursors Disney for example with not just these original cartoons and films and children's television but also things like Epcot than old people's community and Disney World and how all of these interacted with and supported each other on transferred ideas from one place to another then this another example is the doubting system part of the British air defense the integrated air defense system where information from the radars and observers was fed into regional command centers then into localized command centers then into the individual airfields with all of the system managed as a whole but including the human aspects such as how are you going to cope with radio operators who are listening to their boyfriends dying in the air you've got to get them to be able to continue on while in the real time and how all of this is a feedback loop supporting with each elements supporting every other going further back there's things like a lot of the particularly the US railroads where you see it again as an integrated system Ford's factories the same could be said it's an a fully integrated manufacturing all the way out from mines all the way through to delivered delivered and maintained vehicles so how we got here was by this kind of progression from a very narrow view of that strictly IT centric mostly bad infrastructure all the way through to an understanding that it's actually about the whole even beyond to the organization where the enterprise is a story and each one of those elements everything depends on everything else so an architecture is about how things to work on with each other and depend on each other how to get them to work better together and on purpose
