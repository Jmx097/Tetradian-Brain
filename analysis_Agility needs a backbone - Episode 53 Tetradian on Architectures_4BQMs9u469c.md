# Analysis: Agility needs a backbone - Episode 53, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video argues that true organizational agility requires a stable **backbone**—a core of unchanging elements like purpose, values, core data, and rights—that provides structure for rapid adaptation at the edges. It contrasts this with flexible experimentation on the periphery, stable governance in the core, and a middle layer for scaling ideas, drawing on the cheetah analogy for leverage in speed and turns.

## Key Takeaways
- **Agility needs a backbone**: The core (purpose, values, core assets like data as a single source of truth, rights to assets) must remain completely stable to enable edge agility, much like a cheetah's spine allows fast sprints and turns.
- **Core vs. edge distinction**: Essential backbone elements (e.g., core data) stay fixed and control-dependent, while edge elements (experiments, new ideas) and middle-layer items (departmental uses) can move freely, including switching IT providers as long as data is controlled.
- **Multimodal governance**: Backbone requires **waterfall-tight governance** for stability; edges need agile methods; middle acts as a transition zone, inspired by Wardley's pioneers (experiments), settlers (practical implementation), and town-planners (stability).
- **Dynamic flow**: Ideas move from edge experiments inward to the middle for organization-wide use, eventually into the core, while some core elements may shift out over time as business needs evolve.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Identify and protect **backbone elements**: Lock down purpose, values, core data (single source of truth), essential assets, and rights; treat these as non-negotiable for enterprise identity.
- Segment operations by mode:
  1. **Edge**: Run experiments and new ideas with agile governance.
  2. **Middle**: Scale successful edge items for departmental or broader use (e.g., Wardley settlers phase).
  3. **Core**: Apply strict, careful change processes (waterfall governance) only for backbone stability.
- For IT/cloud decisions: Prioritize data control over hardware/legacy systems—freely switch providers without altering backbone data.
- Establish processes for **inward/outward movement**: Regularly assess edge/middle innovations to integrate into core or retire outdated core elements as needs change.

## Quotes
- "Agility needs a backbone if you think of a cheetah then you've got a very fast running animal it can sprint really fast and turn really well because it has a backbone to leverage from to work against."
- "The backbone the core of what's right out of the core of the organization needs to be completely stable like a backbone the edge but even if that it's stable the edge can move around as much as it likes."
- "The backbone really needs to be waterfall tight governments we really do need it to be very stable and to change only with the utmost care whereas out on the edge we need things to be as agile as possible."
- "Ward Lee's idea of pioneers settler and town planner where the pioneers are out experimenting the settlers are making it real and continued into practice and the town planners are keeping things everything's stable."
- "Agility needs a backbone but we need to move things into and out of that backbone over time as the needs of the business change."[1]
