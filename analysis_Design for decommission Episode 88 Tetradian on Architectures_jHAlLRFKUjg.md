# Analysis: Design for decommission: Episode 88, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video argues that enterprise architecture frameworks neglect the decommissioning phase of asset lifecycles, which should be integrated from the design stage to enable easier recycling, reuse, and dismantling. It emphasizes ethical responsibilities and long-term risks, using examples like space junk to illustrate how poor end-of-life planning creates escalating problems.

## Key Takeaways
- Most enterprise architecture frameworks focus only on new builds or updates, ignoring the full lifecycle including decommissioning.
- Decommissioning must be designed in from the start, as it is non-trivial for complex assets like printers, phones, or nuclear submarines, unlike simple digital deletions.
- Architecture should incorporate designing for recycling, safe dismantling, reuse, and ethical considerations—if something can't be decommissioned or recycled, it shouldn't be built.
- Poor decommissioning planning leads to major issues, such as space junk from mini-satellites making future launches dangerous.

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Incorporate lifecycle thinking early**: When designing architectures, explicitly plan for the entire lifecycle from new build to decommission, including adaptations and end-of-life strategies.
- **Assess decommissioning feasibility upfront**: Evaluate how assets will be recycled, dismantled, or reused before building; reject designs that can't be safely decommissioned.
- **Mitigate long-term risks**: For projects like satellite launches, ensure end-of-life plans prevent accumulation of debris or hazards.

## Quotes
- "if we're designing something if we're building the architecture for something surely it should cover the whole of the lifecycle from new build to decommission"
- "designing for what happens at the end needs to be thought about in depth right at the beginning to make the decommissioning easier"
- "if we can't decommissioning it we probably shouldn't build it increasingly if we can't recycle it we probably shouldn't build it"
- "we need to be designing for decommissioning as part of the architect right from the start"
