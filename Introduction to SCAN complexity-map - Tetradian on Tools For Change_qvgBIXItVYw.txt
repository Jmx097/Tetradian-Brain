this video is about a tool called scan which helps you map out complexity and uncertainty in a context I'll do a live diagram for this one okay let's take a look at scan scan is a really simple way of making sense of complexity and then deciding what to do with it so imagine we have well just a straight line just an axis from certain at one end where you know exactly what's going on to inherently uncertain we've got no idea what's going on it's completely unpredictable and somewhere along there there's going to be an axis a transition point between where we have effective certainty where we know enough about what's going on to where we really don't so there's a kind of transition that will move around a bit that we could call effective certainty on this side when we do the same things we're going to get the same results on this side we don't know if we're going to get the same results we may need to do different things to get the same effective results on this side we're following rules things are step-by-step whereas here we're going to need skill there's no real doubt about that at all going the other direction think of the amount of time before if you think of this as now that how much time do we have before we have to take action and also going into what will then be the past where we can review but we can't change anything so from now into the past and also what happens how much time we have before what needs to be the nail the planning that we can do so there's another kind of axis that happens the transition between plan and action what we plan we've got plenty of time to think about things when we're in the midst of action we don't have time to stop but again that's another boundary that is going to move around so if you like that's the the edge of action and we can summarize these with a set of labels think of that as simple it has to be simple for us to do it fast to follow just the rules here we're more complicated we've got time to plan things out over here things are ambiguous they're uncertain but again we have some time to plan it out and sort out the ambiguity down here we're in the not known we don't know what's going on particularly at real time so that gives us simple complicated and big ewis not known gives us scanned
