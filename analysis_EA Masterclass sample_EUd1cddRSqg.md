# Analysis: EA Masterclass sample

## Executive Summary
Tom Graves presents a sample from his Enterprise Architecture Masterclass series, advocating a reframing of the traditional "people, process, technology" model into "actor, scene, stage" to foster a more story-oriented, human-centered view of enterprise architecture. This approach emphasizes relationships, contexts, and narratives over rigid structures, using visual examples like film scenes and emergency centers to illustrate how every element contributes to the overall enterprise story.[1]

## Key Takeaways
- Traditional architecture views ("people, process, technology") can be reframed as **actor, scene, stage** to better reveal relationships, contexts, and dynamics in the enterprise.[1]
- Every process or traversal is a self-contained **story** with its own actors, actions, events, beginnings, middles, and ends, akin to a stage play or script.[1]
- Actors include **everyone** involved—not just people in front of the camera, but all participants—avoiding robotic views of users or anthropomorphizing machines.[1]
- Enterprise processes resemble an **unfolding story or plotline** from the shared enterprise perspective (e.g., supply chain), contrasting with organization-centric "inside-out" views.[1]
- Stories vary by type: **scripted** (e.g., call centers), analyzed, adapted from best practices, or improvised, requiring skill especially for on-the-fly adaptation.[1]
- Use scriptwriting principle **"show, don't tell"**: every action drives the story forward; props (e.g., chairs, trees) provide essential context and support, even non-IT elements like a tree for grounding during long shifts.[1]
- Architecture must consider the full scene, including overlooked props and support services that enable the story.[1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Reframe architecture analysis**: Replace "people, process, technology" with "actor, scene, stage" to identify relationships and contexts; examine images or scenarios (e.g., film set, emergency center) to map actors (all participants), scenes (environments and props), and stages (actions/events like film cameras or ladders).[1]
- **Apply story structure to processes**: Break down processes into scenes with start events, actions/changes, and end events; assess story types (scripted, analyzed, adapted, improvised) and build skills for improvisation.[1]
- **Incorporate props and context**: Inventory all elements supporting the story, including subtle ones (e.g., a tree for stability in an emergency center), to ensure holistic architecture design beyond IT.[1]
- **Course application practice**: Pause during analysis to apply concepts to personal architecture questions, exploring real-world integration.[1]

## Quotes
- "The classic view is to talk about **people process and technology** but another way of looking at this is to think of it in terms of **actor scene and stage**."[1]
- "Every part every process is a **story or collection of stories** every travis through is a kind of self-contained story each with its own actors its only actions its own events that start and end."[1]
- "**Everyone** in this space is an actor in the overall story."[1]
- "A useful phrase that we collect from script writing is the idea of **show don't tell** each line of action drives the story forward."[1]
- "Why is the tree there for example it's not i.t at all why is it part of the architecture well it is because when you're spending eight hours in a shift focusing trying to guide people to find a missing boy **the tree in the middle helps you keep stable keeps you grounded** it has its place in the story."[1]
