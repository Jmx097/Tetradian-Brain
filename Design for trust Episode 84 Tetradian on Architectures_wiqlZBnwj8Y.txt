how do we design for trust why should we design for trust why is trust important well the reality is that Trust is probably the core metric and core asset for an organization if we don't have trust we don't have business it really is as simple as that so we need to understand that it's more important than financials it's more important than almost anything else how do we design for it how have we built it into our architecture the support for trust in everything the first point about about Trust is that it comes from alignment to values that we prove by our actions that we align to values well the values come from the story of the enterprise and we'll come back to that again in another video but the story tells us what the values are we then have to test everything we do and make sure it pervades all the way through the enterprise some simple examples of values are ethics are safer that we are aligned to safety that we align to sustainability that we align to financial in honesty so we've aligned to fairness that there is balance across our structure these are all values that come from the enterprise story we then change those address those values as actionable principles that have got tests associated with them and we also have pervasive services so health and safety is something that is everyone's responsibility how do we act on that what architecture do we need to support health and safety as everyone's responsibility these are real architectural issues that we need to address another very common one we see these days particularly the digital space is the idea of terms and conditions and these are often so ludicrously one-sided and framed in such a difficult way to understand that they really don't make sense and in fact to the level that they are in law what's called unconscious that they're simply not valid the idea that a company can arbitrarily declare a possession of everything that you produce every photograph you'd made because somewhere buried down in their terms and conditions was a clause that you couldn't see that effectively stated that this is not conscionable this is not supportable in law we need to consider these these in our architecture as well so a useful way of looking at that is to instead of thinking of terms and conditions think of it as trusts and commitments what do you commit to do to support the trust of your customers your suppliers the broader community in what you do these are architectural issues where do you build the trust and support for trust in your architecture because without trust you don't have a business
