in this episode we're going to do a follow on from what we looked at in the last episode about capability maps because one of the things that's fascinating is once you have a capability map there are all kinds of other uses that you can put it to that are really valuable particularly in an enterprise architecture environment the first of these was a whole mass of what we called unofficial usages every single manager it seemed did nicked a copy of their own and put it on their wall which they used for things like onboarding showing people what is going on in the organization and where people were where people might have to connect to will also used a lot as a visual directory that people would scribble phone numbers all over it so there were a lot there what we particularly used it for ourselves in enterprise architecture unit was about project mapping we mapped every single project onto the capability map so this showed us straight away where there were overlaps between projects when there were probable clashes between projects and where there were gaps it also helped us make sense of architecture integration and gave us a lot of really useful information about where a gap might sit like there was a little one little project which was a little bit of what we might call glue a piece of information a project of capture information about what was in a truck when it left a sorting Depot for mail and for two or three years that have been turned down because it seemed to have no apparent value but on its own it didn't but when we put it in context with a bunch of other major projects suddenly they this little project added a whole lot of extra value to those other major projects now we had a small discretionary budget where we incur allowed to encourage people and provide funding for small changes to a project to connect things together to make the work better but we could do that only because we could see from the capability map what connected to what it also gave us the basis for what in government's are now is called spend control which is that any project who over a certain size had to show that it wasn't clashing with anyone else it had to show where it connected and where it supported and also how it could actually be how you we could reuse the existing functions I came across one project in a large environment where the effective budget cost dropped from forty million dollars to eight hundred thousand that's cutting down cut ninety eight percent out of the budget just by looking closely at the capability map and mapping projects onto there now the other one which they were using on this is the thing that's before started getting really political and that was mapping capability maps on to activity-based costing that showed us that we could identify what the effect when a project was about to work on somewhere what was the probable business value and the business impact that it would be in terms of activity-based costing now this was massively political it had huge ramifications for people's bonuses and God knows what else so this was not something we could have tackled at all unless we were reporting to the whole executive not many to the CIO so this is something that you can only do when you're working as part of the whole or not as a core function of the whole organization not merely one depart but this really paid off big time so capability maps have enormous numbers of really important extra uses beyond just what you might think of as a capability map
