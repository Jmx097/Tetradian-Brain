# Analysis: Defining an EA method: Episode 90, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video outlines the development of the **Five Elements** (or Seaspar: Contexts, Scope, Plan, Action, Review) method for enterprise architecture (EA), designed to be simple yet robust, applicable to any scope, scale, or context. It emphasizes applying the method to its own design process through iteration, metaphors, and real-world testing to ensure usability by non-specialists while linking modular tools like UNIX plugins.[1][5]

## Key Takeaways
- The **Five Elements method** (Contexts, Scope, Plan, Action, Review) forms a fractal, content-agnostic core that works universally, mirroring patterns like PDCA loops or TOGAF ADM with recursive nesting for any scale.[1][4][5]
- Method design prioritizes **simplicity without oversimplification**, using visuals, metaphors over text, and surfacing hidden assumptions to make it accessible to the "early majority" beyond specialists.[1]
- Development was **self-applied iteratively**: context and success criteria from usability needs drove real-world tests, reviews, redesigns, and loops back to the core purpose of one learnable approach.[5]
- Tools are **plug-and-play** like UNIX files, linking modular components while keeping the basic method unchanged, enabling detail work at any level.[1]
- Focus on **human-centered fractality**: start-anywhere principle, context-first over content-first, avoiding hard-wired assumptions common in traditional EA frameworks.[1][4]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Apply the method to itself for development**:
  1. Define **context** (e.g., make EA usable by anyone, any scale).
  2. Set **scope** and **success criteria** (e.g., understandable, practical, tested in real-world).
  3. Create **plan** with visuals/metaphors.
  4. Execute **action** (build/test tools as plugins).
  5. **Review** outcomes, lessons-learned, iterate in a loop.[1][5]
- Use **OODA-loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)** or **SCAN framework** for real-time plan reassessment during Action phase.[1]
- Conduct **After Action Review (AAR)** post-iteration: What was supposed to happen? What actually happened? Lessons for next cycle.[1]
- Enable **recursive sessions**: Pause current work, spawn child-session for sub-issues, return with updates.[1]
- Build as a **closed loop** for endless iteration, optionally adding Adjourning phase for benefits-realization.[1]

## Quotes
- "We needed a method that would work the same way everywhere any scope any scale any content any context."
- "In CCR everything is a tool everything is a plug in change mapping everything is a plug in tool."
- "Apply the method to its own design we needed to build what is this context what we're trying to do what is the scope what is the plan for action what is the action itself what how can we review this."
- "Focusing on metaphor rather than text making it to make it accessible we also wanted to use it to surface to bring to the surface any hidden assumptions."
- "Build it as a loop so that we could do real-world tests review rethink redesign and loop background connecting always back to the original purpose of a method that works exactly the same way at the core of itself."[1]
