# Analysis: Enterprise architecture and coronavirus: Futures: Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video argues that enterprise architecture must incorporate futures thinking and multiple time scales to adapt dynamically to uncertainties like coronavirus, rather than predicting a single future or returning to an outdated "normal." It emphasizes scenario planning at a global scale, addressing long-term challenges such as resource depletion, climate change, supply chain vulnerabilities, and unsustainable possession-based economies. Organizations should start building adaptive practices now, integrating strategic foresight into enterprise architecture for resilience over decades.

## Key Takeaways
- **Futures are plural**: The future is inherently uncertain and multifaceted, not a single predictable path; it only becomes known when it arrives as the present.
- **Multiple time scales in enterprise architecture**: Projects span 20-100+ years (e.g., military, healthcare, civil engineering like Roman-era sewers), requiring planning beyond the typical 2-3 year horizon.
- **Dynamic adaptation post-coronavirus**: Expect permanent coexistence with the virus; use scenario planning (global-scale stories of possible futures) to enable organizational flexibility, contrasting simplistic use-case scenarios in frameworks like TOGAF.
- **Larger challenges ahead**: Coronavirus is trivial compared to resource depletion, climate change, fragile global supply chains, and the unsustainability of possession-based economies, which resemble pyramid schemes leading to collapse.
- **Urgent action needed**: With 20-30 years lead time for economic shifts, start futures toolkit integration into enterprise architecture now—"the best time to plant a tree was 50 years ago."

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Adopt **scenario planning** at a large scale: Build "stories" about possible futures (e.g., hyperglobalization vs. hyperlocalization breakdowns) and prepare reactions as scenarios emerge more real; monitor and adapt enterprise structures dynamically.
- Integrate **futures disciplines and strategic foresight** into enterprise architecture practices: Combine short-term responses with long-term (50-100+ year) views across sectors like epidemiology and engineering.
- Balance supply chain strategies: Avoid extremes of hyperglobalization (efficiency via single global sources) or hyperlocalization (wasteful inefficiency); aim for "problematique"—dynamic, discussable equilibria over time.
- Transition economies proactively: Abandon possession-based models within 20-30 years; begin sustainable alternatives immediately to avoid self-cannibalization as resources tighten.

## Quotes
- "What's happening to the future? Where will the future be? When can we get back to normal? But there's a real question about what is back to normal? What is normal anyway?"
- "Futures is plural not singular—it's not *the* future but *futures*. That distinction is really important."
- "Coronavirus is unquestionably a huge challenge right now... but these are still quite trivial challenges compared to what's coming up: resource depletion, climate change."
- "I cannot see any way in which a possession-based economy could be made sustainable—it always ends up as being a pyramid game which ultimately can only cannibalize itself into oblivion."
- "The best time to plant a tree was fifty years ago. When we get there, it's already too late."
