in a recent conversation daljeet banger who is the British Computer Society lead on enterprise architecture ask me about opinions about roles and role types for architects there's all sorts of different roles about solution architect project architects security architect applications architects and so on including Enterprise Architect so how they all fit together what are they each and all so that it performs a kind of career path if that's what you choose so the first level there are four distinct levels really does the task architect who's dealing with one thing at a time a solution architect who's dealing with all of the issues around a single project there's a domain architect who's a kind of specialist and an enterprise architect who has to cover everything so a task architect by that I mean someone who's a local specialist is actually where I started in enterprise architecture doing data architecture for a particular project in fact when I was doing development of the original software for desktop publishing I also became a kind of solution architect I had to do the application architecture I had to do the data architecture I had to do the market architecture as well the user interface architecture using its use experience architecture and all of those so that's what a solution architect does a domain architect is a specialist but they cover they cover architecture for a particular domain hence things like brand architecture software architecture applications architecture security architecture all of those kind of themes themes that cross cross-cutting across the whole space but still what we might call a t-shape there's a lot of detail in one area and enough knowledge to how to connect to other areas and finally we have the Enterprise Architect who we might describe as a cone-shaped generalist you've got to be able to connect absolutely everything across the entire space classically this started out in IT but these days an enterprise architect needs to cover anything across the enterprise including beyond the organization itself so we have these four distinct types the early stage work is where you develop the idea of architecture at all in task architecture then solution architecture is about linking all these different areas together a domain architect is another kind of specialist but covers that specialism across the whole space and the enterprise architect is covering really anything and everything across a long period of time as well much longer than the time solution for a single project so that's role types for architects which can also be thought of as a kind of career path if that's what you choose to do
