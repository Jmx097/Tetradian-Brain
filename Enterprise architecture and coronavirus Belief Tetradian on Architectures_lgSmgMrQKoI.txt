yet another theme that's coming up also often in all of the discussions I'm seeing around that pandemic is a tendency to rely too much on belief on unquestioned assumptions there's a huge risk around applying old assumptions to a new context there's a lot that we need to reinvent and reassess all the time there are huge risks particularly about failing to observe what's actually happening and instead of assuming about what's happening but also a huge problem I'm seeing with what's known as policy based evidence the literal opposite of evidence-based policy there's a fundamental trap which I call Gucci's paradox which is that things not only have to be seen to be believed but also have to be believed to be seen if we can't understand how much our beliefs are filtering what what is actually going on we will not be able to make good decisions it's the scan frame here is actually really useful as a variant of the scanner frame which looks at in terms of decisions on how we look at the world that's in scan we have simple complicated ambiguous not known they work out as being an assertion an assertion that something is true looking at something in terms of useless we proceed as if true we have belief where we assert not just assert but it is true we act as if it is true as opposed to a faith level where we take it literally on faith we have to proceed knowing that we don't know so faith starts with this assumption about I don't know remember something I've talked to the Koala burro before about the architects mantra I don't know it depends just enough detail the first requirement there is I don't know the danger with belief is we start from I know this is the truth and when we do that we end up forgetting to look at the world so we look at that sequence of sense make sense decide and act on the world we've got to since first before we can loop round now what happens when we get too locked into a belief is that we miss the sensing part because we assume it's correct we assume it's the same and jump straight back to make the same decision because that gives us the quickest results but at the moment that change of any kind comes into that picture that will fail this is why it is so important to test all the time what our beliefs are and how our beliefs are dominating or controlling or deluding us into into making assertions that actually aren't what's happening so look all the time for various ways to test belief a really good example is the key word like it's obvious or everyone knows how it's always been or it's always true that watch out for key words like that the moment someone says it's obvious it probably isn't another one is watch particularly for misplaced emotion what are the characteristics of when belief takes place in effect we move from the scientist to the believer we move from science to religion it comes with a that shift comes with a lot of emotion so the moment also we start noticing a lot of emotion around or around our assertions of something it's probably not an observation it's almost certainly a belief and it's effectively a religious assertion that this is truth rather than an actual observation this is so now if you like there's a really scary little test you can try on my web blog called bending reality the link is in the description down below do look at that because it will really show you exactly how much of your belief system is based on your actions are based on assumptions rather than on others observation most of what people think of as being the obvious are not rational at all so within our businesses within our work when planning for what we're going to do or what we need to do in order to deal with the changes we're facing now all of those things watch very carefully for belief because in order to see reality we have to be able to question what we believe
