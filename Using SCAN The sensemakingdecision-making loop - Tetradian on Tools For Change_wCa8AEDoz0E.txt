in a previous video we introduced this framework called scan which can help us make sense of complexity it's really very simple it it's just an axis of time how long we have before or after are given now and the degree of uncertainty the degree of unpredictability the degree of uniqueness what I want to do in this video is look at the decision action loop and how we how these interact with each other to form the loop itself so the way I'm going to do it here is just look at it in terms of a straightforward description of sense make sense decide act at any time we can sense something is immediately after the moment of action can be very very close to the moment of action but it's always somewhat after we talk about real time but in fact it's not it always happens after so we're collecting information of what has just happened from there we loop round two before the next now and we make sense of what's going on from there there is a kind of transition point where we having made sense of something we decide what we're going to do on the basis of that of sense-making and from there we then go into the moment of action we act we take action invar now now that all looks straightforward and there's quite a lot of descriptions of this we've got the OODA loop observe orient decide act it's the same frame but there's a catch and that is that it varies according to whether it's certain or uncertain we've got very different ways of working as again we've described in a previous video there's a very real boundary and the simple way that a machine makes sense a machine makes sense with an algorithm and it makes its decisions on the basis of rules so that's a machine but when we're dealing with inherent uncertainty we have to do the same loop a quite different way we still make sense but it's in terms of patterns rather than algorithms it's dealing with inherent uncertainty and the decide that happens happens on the basis of principles those are the things that guide us when we're dealing with the uncertain that's if we're dealing with human or skill to deal with certain versus uncertain so our question here is always our question here is always in terms of what type of makes sense do we need what type of decision do we need what support do we need for those kinds of decisions and also notice that it happens inside itself inside each one of these will be more of them another little one right here and inside of those will be another one and inside of so it becomes highly fractal in that sense depending on where we say the decision must be taken in order to reach that now the action in the now so that's the decision action loop sense makes sense decide act but the way we get there may be different according to whether we're dealing with certainty or truth or and uncertainty or value decision usefulness we can use machines for that part of the loop we generally are going to rely on some kind of skill on that side of the loop so the sense making decision making loop depends on the level of uncertainty that we're dealing with thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
