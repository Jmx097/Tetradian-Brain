# Analysis: Introduction to Five Elements and leadership - Tetradian on Tools For Change

## Executive Summary
The video applies the **Five Elements model** (Purpose, Scope, Plan, Action, Review) to leadership, expanding beyond traditional manager-leader distinctions to identify distinct leadership roles within each domain, between domains, and a central integrating role. It outlines **11 types of leadership** tied to an enterprise vision or story, emphasizing balanced guidance through change processes.[1][6]

## Key Takeaways
- **Five Elements domains** require specific leadership: Purpose (strategy/context), Scope (portfolio/program management/values), Plan (project management/planning), Action (real-time execution, e.g., foreman), Review (after-action assessment/lessons learned).[1][6]
- **Five transitional leaderships** bridge domains: Purpose-to-Scope (triggering action via values), Scope-to-Plan (defining policies/scope), Plan-to-Action (starting execution to avoid analysis paralysis), Action-to-Review (stopping and assessing), Review-to-Purpose (linking completions back to vision).[1]
- **Central leadership** holds the enterprise story/vision, balancing conflicts across domains—ideally the executive, but often needing another role.[1][2]
- Total of **11 distinct leadership types** (5 domain-specific + 5 transitional + 1 central), enabling situational leadership throughout projects and enterprise cycles.[1][2]
- Model draws from cyclic processes like Tuckman's stages, contrasting with linear management hierarchies.[1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Map leadership needs to project phases: Start with **Purpose leadership** for vision/strategy; shift via **values** to Scope (portfolio management); use **project managers** for Plan creation; initiate **Action** with a "start event" to break planning loops; end with **after-action review** against success criteria; reconnect via completions to Purpose.[1][6]
- Assign roles explicitly: Use foremen or equivalents for Action's real-time immediacy; ensure Review leadership despite lacking distinct business roles; designate a central "story-holder" to resolve domain conflicts.[1]
- Apply recursively: Each domain team enacts its own Five Elements cycle; hold everything to an overarching **enterprise story**.[1]

## Quotes
- "there's more to it than that we start off with a need for enterprise vision a story that holds everything together everything is in context of that story and leadership is in turn in relation with that story"
- "with the danger here is analysis paralysis we can keep on planning and planning and planning and planning without actually getting anything started so at some point we need leadership that says we're going to start now"
- "we have five quite distinct types of leadership within each of the domains... five leadership's between each the domains and... one hole in the center eleven distinct types of leadership"
