Peter Thomson asks how do you use enterprise architecture to enable change and what motivates state stakeholders to step outside of their comfort zones well in my experience what works really well is an emphasis on play making it tangible making it fun one real example that we started with very early on in Australia post was showing the difference between physical data people-oriented processes and then business purpose and the drivers for things but with a really simple little cardboard model we made lots of copies of this and people saw them appearing on people's desks because it makes things tangible it makes the difference clear if we rotate it different things come into view we see different comparisons about what's going on another real example was a toy train we used a toy train to illustrate ideas about services and service management for example what are the clashes between services what are the service level agreements how much your service annoy other people how do you intersect with different services with different providers how do you cross over a bridge over other services without actually connecting them but there must be a bridge otherwise you get in each other's way how do you with incidents these are real practical things that we got out of using a toy train to explain ideas about service and another example this was a real one with a large city that was having to go on to business transfer onto a kind of digital transformation because then they now face something like a 50 percent budget cut and had to move over from doing services themselves to having citizens do a lot of the services or a lot of the initial work so we worked on that one with a toy theater and we more for example we modeled how a an individual business process worked this was a process for reporting an accident or reporting damage to the to a city asset we played it out as a little can play with little model figures on a toy theater and illustrated things like who who's in the scene who are the actors in the scene who are the extras who are standing by that are just fill in the details of the seaman clutter it up one of the relationships going on there what's the setting what's the stage who's looking at the stage who else is involved in the stage who's involved with managing what happens on this overall space now then when this happened we what I was working with the enterprise architecture unit and then invited down these two very senior women what was involved with communications between other cities of this same scale and another one was a lead for the elite for strategy for the whole city and then calm down thinking this was going to be all about IT and they were expecting to be totally bored but at the end of it it created so much trust that said if this anything like this ever happens again we want to be involved but it also led on the understandings from that help just build a conventional multi-layered enterprise architecture starting from big picture to the services and service relationships to the logical type structures the the kind of services that we needed without giving names working our way down to physical actually actual systems and actual things that were done and testing out live the actual process that changed processes that we would used including continuous learning from that loops of building the architecture of a continuous loop but we were able to do that because we made the whole thing engaging we made the whole thing fun that's actually what gets people to be motivated for change
