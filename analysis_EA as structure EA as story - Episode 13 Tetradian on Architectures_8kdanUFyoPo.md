# Analysis: EA as structure, EA as story - Episode 13, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video argues that enterprise architecture (EA) must balance **structure**—such as organizational charts and IT models—with **story**, the human narrative that drives the broader enterprise. Drawing from Matthew Frederick's book, it contrasts architecture as "truth" (structure) versus "narrative" (story), emphasizing that over-focusing on structure disconnects from the shared enterprise story, which no one can fully possess.[1][4]

## Key Takeaways
- Most existing EA, especially in IT, emphasizes **structure** but neglects the **human story** or narrative aspect.[1][2]
- Distinguish **organization as structure** from **enterprise as story**—the enterprise encompasses a larger, shared narrative beyond formal structures.[1][4]
- Architecture succeeds by understanding how **structure supports the story** and vice versa, requiring balance to maintain human connection.[1]
- Stories underpin strategies, scenarios, use-cases, requirements, and change efforts in EA.[1][2][5]
- EA tools and methods are strong on structure but often weak on narrative, leading to ineffective storytelling.[1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- Balance EA work by focusing equally on **narrative** and **structures**: map how organizational structures intersect with and support the enterprise's shared story.[1]
- Use stories to engage stakeholders: treat every model, strategy, or change as a narrative to elicit feedback, reaffirm decisions, and guide influence without direct authority.[1][2]
- Identify the enterprise story's core elements (e.g., vision, actors like systems or strategies) and evolve narratives dynamically as the business changes.[2]
- Apply storytelling in EA phases: address "why" (vision), "what" (infrastructure/requirements), and "how" (implementation/governance).[3]

## Quotes
- "Architecture as an exercise in truth or architecture as an exercise in narrative which focus is much more on the human side."[1]
- "Organization as structure whereas the enterprise is a story... although we can possess a structure we can't possess a story."[1][4]
- "In an architecture we need to get the balance right between structure and story to focus on the narrative as much as on the structures and look closely at how they link together."[1]
