I want to do a brief three-part series on digital transformation on particular issues that we've seen coming up and the first point here perhaps is that the term even the term digital transformation is itself a bit of a misnomer because it's not actually the digital sign that transforms we're using the technology to change things yes but it's only a technology change the technology itself doesn't transform what does transform or what we're asking for to transform is people's relationship with the technology with the processes and with each other and that really is a transform so for example a change is really quite trivial whereas a transformation is much more fundamental we're asking people in a transformation to shift their whole metaphors their assumptions about how things work about who should things how things should work we're asking them to change their as their relationships perhaps particularly things like relationship distance the distance between people going through various bits of Technology how far we have people apart and how much we expect the machines to do the mediation on people's behalf while looking at often at very different responsibilities literally response abilities the ability to change the ability to respond and asking putting a lot of those responsibilities on to the technology but doing so means that all the other responsibilities in the overall system that get moved on to the people in ways that often shift the whole perspective another one is often we're asking people to change the incentives and to work with quite different incentives for the way that they previously were if we don't we deal with the politics of this we're going to be in trouble because people are not going to be willing to take on that transformation and the politics overall are huge both the internal politics and often the external politics they relate the way in which we relate with others the way in which we ask people to take on responsibilities those are all parts of a digital transformation and the way we support a transformation is not through the technology itself it's through some through story through personal example through demonstration that he did is actually going to be a better way of working for everyone rather than just for one put one particular group if it's only going to make things easier for the business then you're going to lose customers because it's making life harder for them really think through the human side and then consider what technology will fit better to that way around we need to be thinking human first not technology first
