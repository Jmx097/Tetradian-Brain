I'm jealousies Correa asked me to tackle the question around that no one framework fits everything there is no the framework for enterprise architecture what we really have is a kind of challenge around same and different my own experience is in places like telecommunications logistics and engineering and all of the frameworks that we have have to be adapted to fit for example in Australia Post we had two more must roll our own because there was no framework available that actually match what we needed what we need then is some some way of building compatibility or some way of describing what we do which is where reference frameworks comes in a reference framework is a local adaptation of some kind of standard that provides a local standard but it's still compatible with the larger space the challenge then is how to adapt it we have to have some kind of way of retaining compatibility we don't just invent from scratch so we use an existing framework and then use our understanding of how the local space works to amend and adapt while still noting very carefully what is the same and what is different because the sameness allows us to learn from others this is where meta models come in the whole what we call that a matter of meta which is where metamodels meta frameworks meta methodologies the term meta is actually an indication that it's gone recursive a meta model is still just a kind of model but it's a model whose job it is to show us how to build models a meta framework is a kind of framework that helps us build other frameworks because as we adapt things we need to work out what we're going to change and what remains the same a meta framework provides us with the guidance to do that so we also have a meta meta model which is a for creating meta models that will help us create models so meta is this kind of recursion and a lot of the disciplines about using the patterns that a meta model shows us or a meta framework of some kind will show us and then keeping the adapt adaptation keeping the original frame consistent with the base and then showing how we've added our other stuff on to it so no one framework fits all that's entirely correct but by using meta frameworks and metamodels meta methodologies we can build ones that are compatible with others while still retaining our own uniqueness our own unique flavor in the space
