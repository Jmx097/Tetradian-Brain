20/20 hindsight will probably call it looking back trying to make get the lessons learned about resilience about business continuity and all a lot more of that we've got to do to get the best the best opportunity out of this mess that we're currently in but to do that we need some way of learning some way of capturing and it's useful to look at it from the in terms of looking backwards if we're going to do a review and after-action review then we need data from each of the things that we're doing now we need to be able to compare in order to have something to learn which means that in every action we need to be capturing the information capturing the insights if we don't do that there's no way of going back in time to get it again but to do that also we need to have had enough of a plan to make sure that we're collecting the data in the first place the information the insights so on the top of that we need to have scope clarity and all the rest so once we understand the importance of that we've then got how do we actually learn from it and for that I use a modified version of the standard US Army after-action review it goes in its there's two rules they're absolute one of them is that pin your stripes at the door everyone had a job to do everyone is responsible for their part no one is more important than any other if we can't get that then we're going to learn nothing and the other even more important rule no blame the moment there is blame no one is going to learn anything everyone is going to play cover your backside so those are the two rules the other action review has really five parts to it the first one was what was supposed to happen that means that we need to have had it some kind of plan to be able to make sense of what we were seeing around second one is what actually happened well again to do that we need to be capturing that information which should be part of the plan next one what was the source of the difference between what we expected and what we actually got and for the coronavirus issues at the moment there's a lot of gaps that we'll be starting to see things that fell over things that didn't work at all but also some surprising ones that did such as one I just heard today about people saying that they had 68 people in a zoom meeting and after it they decided they actually didn't want to do in-person meetings again so there are some useful insights to be gained so having understood what the sources are we then look at it in a personal sense and say what can I do differently to do it better next time what did I miss what did I learn and then finally what could we do differently we're always part of a team so all the individual I I what can I do better there's also how we interact with each other so what can we learn to do better as a team next time it kind of thing like this comes around so looking with hindsight 20/20 looking at this disastrous year with systemic way it will give us the best learnings that's one things that we can learn from looking at enterprise architecture looking with enterprise architecture lens for the whole coronavirus mess
