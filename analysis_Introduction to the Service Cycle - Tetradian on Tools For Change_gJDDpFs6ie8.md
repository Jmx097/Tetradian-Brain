# Analysis: Introduction to the Service Cycle - Tetradian on Tools For Change

## Executive Summary
The video introduces the **Service Cycle**, a universal pattern for every product or service transaction, emphasizing stages from shared purpose to full completions that maintain trust and stakeholder satisfaction. It warns against the "quick profit cycle," which skips essential relationship-building and completion steps, leading to long-term failure and anti-clients.[1]

## Key Takeaways
- The Service Cycle follows a sequence: shared purpose, connection and scope, agree on plan/contract, setup transaction, perform delivery/action, then completions (action end, contract, relationship, shared story).[1]
- Each stage is supported by distinct services like marketing (shared purpose), sales (connection/scope), delivery (action), accounts (contract completion), and customer service (relationship/story).[1]
- Completions occur in reverse order, matching prior steps, and must satisfy all stakeholders in the shared enterprise, not just transactors.[1][2]
- Applies to human or machine actors; over-focusing on transaction/delivery ignores critical context from prior stages.[1]
- Avoid the "quick profit trap": rushing from contract to transaction to provider-only completion erodes trust, values, and invites regulators or angry stakeholders.[1][2]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Map your service interactions**: Use the Service Cycle to review transactions—start with shared purpose (enterprise story via brand/reputation), build personal connection and policies/scope, agree on contract details (e.g., handshake), setup and execute transaction (context-dependent, model processes here but not in isolation), then complete in reverse: confirm action end (provider view), settle contract (e.g., payment via accounts), close relationship (post-delivery, like eating bought food), reaffirm shared story for all stakeholders.[1]
- **Identify stakeholders**: Reference the "holomap" from a prior video to map all players watching the cycle; ensure completions satisfy the entire enterprise, including customers' customers.[1]
- **Spot broken cycles**: Check for quick profit signs—skipping purpose/connection/story leads to short-term gains but long-term risks like regulatory backlash; always tie back to values and trust.[1][2]

## Quotes
- "Every transaction for service or product follows the same overall pattern. (Or _needs_ to follow that pattern, rather - because if we don't, bad things tend to happen, particularly over the longer term.)"[1]
- "Don't try to shortcut that sequence or cycle... you lose the purpose the connection with people the connection to the story you lose the connection to values to trust to policies it all falls apart."[1]
- "It's always about the overall shared story not just the promises made to each other but tying to the story itself and every stakeholder is watching."[1]
- "The quick profit cycle is a really quick way to create a lot of anti clients of people who are committed against our organization."[1]
