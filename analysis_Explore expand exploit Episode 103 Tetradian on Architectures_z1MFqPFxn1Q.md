# Analysis: Explore, expand, exploit: Episode 103, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video critiques the oversimplified "explore then exploit" or Bimodal IT model, advocating for an "explore, expand, exploit" framework that includes a crucial middle "expand" phase to bridge innovation and production, addressing scaling and usability issues. It draws on Simon Wardley's pioneers-settlers-town planners model and Everett Rogers' technology adoption curve to warn against dysfunctional exploitation that creates technical debt and waste. Proper linking across phases ensures responsible resource use and loops back to new innovations.[1]

## Key Takeaways
- The classic "Mode 1/Mode 2" or "explore-exploit" dichotomy is flawed as it omits the "expand" phase, which links exploration (pioneers/innovators) to exploitation (town-planners/early majority) and handles scaling, reliability, and real-world usability.[1]
- "Expand" overlaps with explore and exploit, starting midway through exploration to refine prototypes into scalable, production-ready solutions, preventing startup failures at scale.[1]
- "Exploit" carries dual meaning: functional (efficient, reliable resource use) versus dysfunctional (irresponsible extraction, dumping problems on others, leading to technical debt); it maps to Rogers' early/late majority and laggards ("stairs" at the "other bleeding edge" reusing old tech).[1]
- Dysfunctional models turn early majority into mere buyers and exploiters without responsibility, ignoring innovators and laggards, which consultancies promote.[1]
- Full model loops back from laggards to innovators, emphasizing honesty, fairness, and respect in exploitation to avoid waste.[1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Reframe processes**: Replace "explore-exploit" with "explore-expand-exploit" in organizational change-management; ensure overlap where expand begins mid-explore (e.g., refining prototypes with cloud services for scaling, privacy, compliance) and hands off mid-exploit.[1]
- **Support all phases**: Assess your enterprise-architecture for dedicated roles/teams in explore (prototyping), expand (scaling/usability), and exploit (efficient production); bridge Bimodal IT gaps by providing settler/early-adopter support.[1]
- **Avoid scaling pitfalls**: Design holistically for non-IT scaling during expand, not just IT; test prototypes early for reliability and efficiency to prevent failures common in startups.[1]
- **Mitigate dysfunction**: In exploit, prioritize functional exploitation (least wasteful use) over dumping; maintain links to future reuse by laggards/stairs, tracking technical debt.[1]

## Quotes
- "it's pushed the idea that there is mode one which is people who deal with stuff that is stable keeping the lights on all that kind of thing... mode two that deals with change... just plain wrong not least because it leaves it out an extremely important middle that links between them."
- "explore expand exploit we first do the exploration but we then make that exploration what we found during exploration into something useful and also deal with issues such as scale."
- "a lot of startups fail completely when they hit a scaling problem... if we don't design for scaling as a whole rather than just the easy IT bit then we're gonna hit huge problems."
- "exploit is in the sense of Kirov valent functional sense is exploiting the resources that we have making good use of it... but there's also the negative version about exploit in the sense of exploitation a very dysfunctional view."
- "be very careful about what happens when we get to that exploit phase and how we clearly link it background to the new to the next way of reusing the same technologies... explore new ideas we make them usable as we expand that idea we then exploit it but always be careful to make sure that when we're exploiting... being clear being honest being fair being respectful as opposed to exploiting and dumping all the problems on everyone else."[1]
