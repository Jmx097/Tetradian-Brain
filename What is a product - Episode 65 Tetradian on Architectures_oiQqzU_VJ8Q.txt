in this episode I want to continue this discussion about the relationship between service and product and ask what actually is a product if we're starting from a service oriented perspective this one was particularly suggested by a conversation with Peter Mullins who would like to thank a lot for the conversation we've had around this the way I look at it is that a product is actually something that sits in a gap between services it's effectively a kind of frozen service it's the output of one which is why we talked about it being a product and the input to another service which is where it becomes an input but on its own it's completely static it does nothing on its own it only ever does a product only ever does something as part of a service so product exists in and in fact because of a gap between services so one thing that's useful is whenever we see a product look for the services what is it what is the gap that is sitting between what is the source of the boundary as a boundary of time for example where it sits in a gap because we're waiting for something else to happen it can be a gap in location we produce a product in order to pass it to another country or to another department there's often an age of responsibility where there's a handover from one person to another or from one system to another or one organization to another there's a change of responsibilities of age of responsibility there so the moment we see something that looks like a product look for the services that it sits between why is it sitting in that gap but also the possibility for any kind of services this is where the term affordances comes in a cup can be something to drink from but you can also use it as a paperweight you can use it as a hammer you can use it as a bell it affords all these possibilities it may have a specified but it affords many others so the services that it connects between may not necessarily be the ones that we expect beforehand and a product may also be a transfer of responsibilities for example when we look at a sales process it's not actually selling the product it's passing over the responsibility of the product of the sales process is actually the transfer of perhaps money in one case but certainly the transfer of responsibility you've signed a contract that says the responsibility of the ownership has now moved from one place to another that's the product of the sales process itself is that record so a product never actually does anything on its own it's always part of a service if it's not being used it's like a frozen service the product always exists because of a gap between services and if there's a gap between services what's the source of the boundary whenever we see a product look for the services that it sits between if it represents a gap what are these services and what will awaken the next service to doing things happen and often some kinds of products are actually transfers of responsibility the real product of the sales process is the transfer of responsibility not the product that is being sold
