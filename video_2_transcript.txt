hi everyone I'm going to welcome back to my channel you know one of the most popular questions that I always get is how do I stay organized and how do I keep all of my leads and everyone that I speak to organized in like a database now there are many resources out there there are many crms but in this video i'm going to be covering one resource that i recently started using and I have completely fell in love with and that is Trello prior to me starting to use Trello which I started consistently since December I had looked into it about a year ago but when I first looked into it it just seems so complicated and I feel that over the Christmas and winter break something just kind of clicked and I learned how to use it pretty much in like a day now Trello is a platform it's completely free it's online and the best thing is that it also comes in the form of a mobile app so you can download it on your phone and you can have access to everything that you have online on your dashboard but at your fingertips so without me continuing to blabber on let's get into this almost what's going to be like a tutorial [Music] so what I'll be doing is that I will be recording on here on my camera but I will also be screen recording so you'll see both of us at the same time now this right here is the main landing page for Trello really what it allows you to do is that it allows you to organize pretty much everything that you have going on and it also allows you to collaborate with other people so let's say you are working with a team all of you in the team can log onto Trello you can share what are called boards which is kind of like let's say chat groups where you post different things regarding what you're working on whether it's projects you'll see how I use it and it's gonna make a lot more sense but yeah Trello lets you invite a lot of people so that you can all have access to this dashboard where everyone knows exactly what's going on as you can see right here you can work with your team it also allows you to have information at your fingertips with the mobile app which is really convenient and one of the things that I absolutely love so what I'm gonna do right now is that I'm actually going to log on to my account so that you can see exactly how I'm using it so obviously I have an incognito here so that you can see what it actually looks like when you're now logged on so let's say you create an account it's completely free once you log in it's gonna be looking something like this so the first thing that you're going to do and again the way that I use this is for organizing pretty much all of my leads and everything that I have going on real estate-related so I will go on boards so you go on there and then I will create a new board so right here for the sake of this video let's say I'm naming it real estate organization and it gives you the option if you want to create it for your team or if you just want to do it for yourself so let's say I'm just going to do it for myself you can make a private or public for this case specifically I'm going to make it private because if you're going to do this yourself you to want to make it private since it's just something that's going to be for you or anybody that you invite to see your board so now we're gonna hit create board you can actually change the background if you go right here to the right change background you can add your custom picture to it you can go on your photos you can pick a color let's say I'm going to go under photos let's pick four examples homes so we're gonna pick let's scroll down in I don't know we'll just use this one that way you can actually that one does not look that appealing we'll use this one this one's really nice okay so this obviously since it's real estate we want to put a house in the background again you can pick whatever it is that you want so now that we've changed our background what we're gonna do is that we're going to start creating different lists now these lists imagine it being almost like tabs in a notebook and this is where you're going to keep all of the information that you want to refer to or keep organized so the first list that we're going to do is going to be the to-do list and again Trello and this is something that you're going to be looking at every single day whether it's on your dashboard on your computer or on your phone so we have a to-do list we have let's say hot leads cold leads warm leads active transactions open houses sign calls referrals you guys get the idea I'm just gonna do those lists because I could keep on going on and on but I want you just to get the gist of it so now we're going to do the to-do lists now one thing that I like to do is that and that you can do for each of these is that you can put a cover picture so for this card the very first one this is where I'm going to be posting that cover photo so the cover photo is just pretty much what the list name is but in a picture so it can stand out and they'll be more appealing to your eye once you're scrolling through trying to find out the tab that you're looking for so let's say we're going to do the two the to do so the card is just going to say to-do list for today or whatever it is that you want to name it and then enter you're going to double click it and it's gonna take you to this so we're going to go to the right and we're going to add cover so right here is where we add covers and you can upload a picture if you would like what I have done is that I have gone on canva and I have created my own pictures you can also just use one of the ones that the platform has provided but let's say I'm going to upload a cover image so this is these are all my files let's say I think I have one of two do I do here it is because again everything that I'm showing you right now is exactly what I have in what I do on my Trello can see there you go so now that is a cover picture for that list so we're just gonna close out of there so let's say we're going to do this day by day and again this is the to-do list so you just you're just going to add everything that you need to do is going to be its own card so for today we're going to do create a social media post for listing now let's say you actually want to set a deadline for that you're going to double click on that and then on the right right there you see it says due date so let's say today is one say I'm filming this right now it's 8 o'clock at night but let's say I want this due tomorrow tomorrow Thursday the 9th at 4:00 p.m. and then I'm gonna save and it actually gives you a reminder so let's say I want to reminder two hours before 15 minutes before let's do one hour before so I'm going to save and then it's already there if you can see right here it shows me that there's a reminder now like I mentioned earlier if you are in a team or let's say you are working with another agent on something or you have an assistant this is a great platform where you can invite your assistant or whoever is your admin that way you can all see what's going on and you can also pretty much right here where you said where you see that it says add to card members let's say you didn't have an admin you can put the admins name and then if this is a task that you would want them to do then they know they have to do it by January 9th at 4:00 p.m. so this is just an example so pretty much this is how I use the to do for the hot leads we'll do the same thing again right here how leads for me is anybody that's ready to do something in 30 days or less so hot leads ready in 30 days or less again I'm going to double click it I'm going to add a cover because I like things to look nice and it's more attractive and it makes me actually want to do something when I see pictures I'm just a visual person so I'm gonna upload a cover now for hot leads the way that I use it is that for the cards I put the actual leads name so for example Joe Schmo in Laguna Beach January listing let's say this person Joe Schmo wants to sell his house this month so that's pretty much what I put on there you can do whatever it is that you want that'll help you and will remind you who that person is so now what I'm going to do is that I'm gonna double click now under description this is where I'm going to add that person's address and any information that I have that will help me so let's say it's 1 2 3 Ocean Avenue Laguna Beach owes 500,000 we'll be moving to Montana whatever you get the point so we'll save it on there and then something else that I like is that let's say I have already taken this listing I can actually attach let's say the listing agreement or any documents on there if you're not around and an email needs to be sent and your admin is also included in this Trello dashboard then they have access to it and this is something that I've done before so you can upload files on there let's say you are supposed to speak to them on a certain day again you can put the due date on there and something that I do is that every time they just speak to somebody or I have an update what I do is that I'll go under activity and where it says write comment let's say I typed this in three months ago and I was supposed to call them today and I did under activity I would put spoke to them today still not ready call back come back on Monday progress is they have clean garage something like that you get the point so this is something that I love because now I can just put on there my notes and it'll tell me the date at the time that I have posted it when I do look back on it so I hope that you guys are kind of getting the point on how it is that I use this and that goes the same for cold leads warm leads active transactions for open houses if you the way that I would use it is if you have any open houses coming up you put the address on there you put perhaps what you're going to be doing to promote the open house any social media posts that you want to be putting out there you can actually create the post put it on there and if you have like a social media person or your admin that's supposed to be doing the posting they could just grab that picture and do it whenever that activity is said to be done and yeah I hope that this has helped you and I hope that he have understood I know I kind of went pretty fast but again when I first looked into Trello I found it's overwhelming I think I was looking at way too many tabs and this way that I just explained it to you it's probably the easiest way that I can explain it that has worked for me and something that I have done for you is that I have created a template specifically for you guys so that you don't have to worry about doing all this and what if you mess up I have already done that for you which is this tab right here you can click on the link in the description box and that will take you to this template this is a completely free template that I have created again for you guys done lender updates if you're working with a lender and you need some updates on certain buyers you can put the buyers names on there if you have any referrals you can put the referrals the names or the agents or whatever it is any active clients appointment so you have set hot leads warm leads cold leads sign calls I do that as well any sign calls that I get from people that are actually motivated or serious or are some type of lead I'll put them on there this is a free template for you guys so you can actually edit it yourself to whatever it is that you do for your business with that being said I hope that you did enjoy this video to something new that I will be starting to do or I talk more about applications and different type of techie stuff if you have any other questions or any other video ideas let me know in the comment section below and I will see you guys on the next one
