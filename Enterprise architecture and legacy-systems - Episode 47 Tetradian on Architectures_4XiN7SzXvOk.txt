this one's about enterprise architecture at a legacy systems and comes from a couple of questions from Alan Lloyd and from JC Jacek the crucial point here we need to get over is that enterprise architecture is not only about the new but about what we've got already I'm working with what we have we rarely work on a pure greenfield site a site where there's nothing good existing we have to think also about what already exists so I don't know it asks about legacy systems and life cycles and JC jessic talked about time and life cycles so they're quite closely related Alan Lloyd was talking about CEOs and so on are feeling the pinch as to disruption legacy systems investment and the onslaught of apps and sandblasting their existing core business whereas we also look at need to look at how things the life cycles about how the late end is still important a late end of life there's a useful frame here that one is simon woodleigh's idea of life cycle versus technology diffusion but it's useful to think in terms of the classic five-step technology life cycle technology diffusion we talk about innovator early adopter early majority late majority and laggards or another way of looking at it which Simon Wardley preferred was pioneer settler and town planner to which I put it they did the the two of exploiter and stea now an innovator is someone who's creating new ideas that's a greenfield site an early adopter is making that new idea usable but by the time we get to the early majority were in context of what already exists and what we're adding has to work with what already exists by the time we talk about the late majority there focus mostly on exploiting making use of what already exists and anything new is to be a disruption and a stayer or a laggard is someone who is using old technology but probably in very useful ways an analogy I tend to think of is people at the rare breeds trust who are keeping old bloodlines going well there are whole technologies that are very old technologies that are still very useful today think of COBOL programming language still being used in banking or even things like core memory the old magnetic core memory that's still being used in very old military systems because it doesn't it isn't affected at all by electromagnetic pulses so the late end the lot last part is still very important and in a sense out of the late people are actually innovators in their own right and can give us crucial ideas for something new a lot of technology life cycles consist of repeating again or already worked in the past so what we're looking at an enterprise architecture we need to take into account of the legacy systems that already exist and the reasons why they're there and not view them simply as something to ignore or to reject there's a lot we can learn from old systems particularly if we take this a clearer understanding about what is an innovator or but innovator does what is an early adopter making it real an early majority wants to have step-by-step instructions they want to start exploiting it too late majority are focused only on exploiting what already exists and don't like the disruption that occurs when anything new is introduced and the laggards these stairs are the people who keep the old technology going keep the lights on in ways that we probably don't even notice and we need to so look at enterprise architecture as part of a whole looking at whole life's whole of life life cycles looking at legacy systems and seeing how weak work with them rather than ignore them
