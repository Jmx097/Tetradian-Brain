one of the things I come across a lot is a problem around definitions people particularly even in enterprise architecture still struggle with the idea that definitions need to be consistent everywhere otherwise we don't get communication we lose clarity we've got a real Tower of Babel problem here now when we go to a different businesses they've all got a random collection of terminology which is all context specific every business describes a business system of us as business capability versus business unit versus business service in different ways we have to be able to support the fact that they're all different we need to be able to support the fact that while translating between natural languages like English and French are bad enough translating between finance and HR is a huge problem we need consistent terminology at the root to be able to handle things well so one thing I've been working on for a long time and really want to promote is a simple consistent set of language of terminology that is the same everywhere at every level so a service is described in the same way regardless of whether it's a web service executed by code a service of changing sheets of a foot of an ill person a very much in person service or whether we're talking about the services of the organization as a whole or environmental or ecology services provided by trees we describe them in exactly the same way so they all have assets functions capabilities locations events and decisions that's a consistent way of describing a service so we need so the same thing means the same thing the same same term means the same thing everywhere having that kind of core also makes it easier to support translation the catch is that that kind of terminology is somewhat abstract so we need to be careful not to try to force it on others and say there's only one term there's only one way of describing an abstract thing but in the real world it's always going to be context specific the other thing that connects with this is about standards there are many standards and we need to follow them and there's good with good reason because they help us with communication and getting things working the same way sometimes we do need to break for standard that can't be avoided sometimes but we need to know why we're breaking our standards we also need to know when we're breaking our standard but we better have a good reason for breaking a standard because standards and definitions aid in communication if we mess them up or if we're careless about them we will be causing trouble for ourselves and others definitions matter we need to remember that in enterprise architecture
