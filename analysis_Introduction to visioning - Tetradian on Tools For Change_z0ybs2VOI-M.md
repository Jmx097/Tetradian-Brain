# Analysis: Introduction to visioning - Tetradian on Tools For Change

## Executive Summary
The video introduces visioning as a core element of organizational context, defining an enterprise vision as a concise three-word story that unifies the shared enterprise beyond the organization itself. It differentiates this from the Business Motivation Model's vision (which aligns more with goals) and uses TED's "ideas worth spreading" to illustrate how vision derives roles, missions, goals, values, and success criteria.[8][1]

## Key Takeaways
- Vision is a unifying **story** for the entire enterprise, distinct from the organization's narrower role, mission, and goals within that story.[1]
- Effective vision statements are short (3-10 words max), structured as **focus + action + driver** (e.g., TED: "ideas" [focus] + "spreading" [action] + "worth" [driver]).[1][8]
- The enterprise is a **shared story** linking diverse stakeholders; organizations position themselves via roles (e.g., TED does conferences/videos, speakers create ideas).[1]
- Vision informs **values** (from the driver, e.g., "worth") and **success criteria** assessed before, during, and after by the whole enterprise, not just the organization.[1]
- Visioning anchors how organizations align promises and performance to enterprise-wide expectations.[1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
The video provides a **three-part method** to create a vision statement:
1. **Identify the focus**: What is everyone in the enterprise concerned about? (TED: ideas)[1][8]
2. **Define the action**: What is everyone doing about it? (TED: spreading)[1][8]
3. **Specify the driver**: Why is it important? (TED: worth spreading)[1][8]

From this vision-story, derive:
- **Roles** from the action (e.g., organization's role in spreading).
- **Values and success criteria** from the driver (e.g., assess "worth" before/during/after via application, learning).[1]
Test alignment enterprise-wide, linking to tools like values-derivation and stakeholder-mapping.[1][3]

- "Vision role mission goal so to understand mission to understand vision we need to understand what the enterprise is what the story is that holds everyone together."[8]
- "Everything that we do within the organization is then tested by not just ourselves that's our mission and our goal but about how everyone in that enterprise sees how we are doing our goal."[8]
- "What is our focus what is the action that where everyone is doing what is the driver that makes it worthwhile."[8]
