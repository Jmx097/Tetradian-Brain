in the previous episodes in this short series we've looked at the idea of myth quakes about that a myth is an unverified or untested assumption that a myth quake occurs when we have a clash between our assumptions and reality we've got a myth quake scale to help measure the potential risk or the potential severity and we also looked at myth quakes has been potential opportunity something useful to us something that we want to create or what to have but so what do we do about myth quakes particularly from an enterprise architecture perspective the first point is about principles and practices the first one is that we need some realism we need critical thinking we need discipline and we need self honesty without those we're going nowhere we're going to be at the mercy of every myth quake that comes along so myth quake preparedness means that we face the myth quakes we probably look for the risks the opportunities the implications of a clash this is often where the politics of enterprise architecture come in and exactly why enterprise architecture is so relentlessly political in practice because we're working helping people to work through all of the myth quakes preferably before they become too severe remember that refusing to face a potential myth quake increases the risk increases the potential severity we also need to build myth quake resilience about how we recover from myth quakes the first level one is system plea the embarrassment of having fallen for a myth quake from having an assumption that was challenged we need to have the emotional strength and resilience to cope with that and not trying to fight off the myth quake and we also need intentional engagement to say I know that I don't know to say that I know I've got assumptions here that I'd haven't tested yet and therefore there may well be myth quakes arising from those failures to test so we reach out we build tactics around realism around crude development of critical thinking around the discipline of facing up to myth quakes and the self-honesty to actually say yeah it's an assumption there are problems however we're there well there's a very real need a huge need for critical thinking precisely because of the presence of myth quakes there's usually a huge anti want for critical thinking we have to build that even though people don't necessarily want it because it's scary embarrassing on the rest we need people to build preparedness resilience and engage directly with them what's important here is that the same principles apply for every level of myth quake so dealing with the small learning how to deal with the small everyday issues helps us survive the big ones it gives us practice on dealing with big issues and all of our toolkit for enterprise architecture particularly procedures are generalized tools for change where change is all about myth quakes leads us to the need to move the scale from everyday enterprise architecture to a literally global scale in order to have the tools that we need to face the really big myth quakes that are coming our way so there's a simple concept the idea of a myth quake of an untested assumption meeting up with reality and what we need to do to work with
