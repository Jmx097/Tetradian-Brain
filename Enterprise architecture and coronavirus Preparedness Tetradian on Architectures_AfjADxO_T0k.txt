one of the themes I'm seeing now is a sense of that after nearly three months it's all over it's it's coming to the end we've flattened the curve it's finished the reality unfortunately is that the current virus is anything but finished if we look at the history of other pandemics particularly the 1918 global flu the second wave was much worse than the first because people relaxed people thought it was over so there's a real danger about being lulled into thinking that it's all over and there's also not only the frustrations about being cooped up unfortunately a lot of politics we won't cover that at all it's just we notice that it's there so from a business perspective we really need to be thinking first about about thinking about what happens next when we get if we're going to get something anything like the 1918 flu which is lots of continuing action over lots of periods of time with sporadic changes so but before we do that we really need to review first we need to do an after-action review an after-action review the fundamentals are no blame and pinion stripes at the door no one is more important than anyone else everyone had a role to play we've had a very strong and especially this is that most of the so-called essential work in the coronavirus was people who are the lowest pay but still the most involved without which things don't happen so we need to get clear about what works so when we look at this for each of the actions what was supposed to happen was there a plan at all did we have a risk management plan if we didn't then we definitely need one what actually happened what's the actual information that we have about what went on do we have any information about what actually happened in our business in terms of the disruptions then we say what's the source of the difference what worked what didn't work giving equal importance to both not focusing on what didn't work but we focus on what did work as well and we look for the lessons learned what can we do differently next time if there's anything like this because bluntly there is going to be something like this so we then need to get ready for what's basically a random disruption this time around pretty much everything closed down in a on a countrywide basis in most cases but what we're coming up to is as we get better at track and trace there's going to be little random disruptions little hotspots flaring up which means that from widespread business you're going to have individual areas that suddenly don't work so it's a quite different kind of disruption it's always harder to work with so we need checklists relative in a fire environment what are your assets where are they located how can you move them to be better situated for a random change another one is to focus on fungibility in other words you can exactly interchangeability what can I swap in that will do the same job and particularly adaptability on-the-fly and we look at big natural disasters like the Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans there's a lot of requirement for ability to adapt I think is the head of Walmart said a lot of you are going to have to make decisions far above your level that's fine so but also what came out of that was the really important real importance of having support from the top as to what we're expected to do when we are having to do things differently from our normal way of working it's fine having us fixed set of rules and roles and responsibilities and reporting relationships when everything is stable when it's not we need a quite different way to do this and we need to know the difference between the two but if we look at an army for example in peacetime and stable conditions were nothing's happening it has a very hierarchical set of rep of reporting relationships when it's going into real time chaos which is what the battlefield is essentially but then the communication structure changes completely it's much more lateral but the hierarchy is a hierarchy of information flow rather than a hierarchy of command it's the role of the hierarchy is to keep everyone informed rather than try to control so we need to think of our organizations in those circumstances where suddenly someone is going to be dumped in chaos well the rest of us are carrying on around them but it's difficult to deal with that kind of variance so the only one is always to also to link risk and response and risk and opportunity as a symmetric pair we never get risk without opportunity we never get opportunity without risk so we need to work with them always as a pair whenever we're looking at the risks of nothing what can we learn for example very real example a lot of organizations had believed before that they could not do work at home well now many organizations have found that yes they can and they can do it very fast indeed switching things in and out to be able to deal with this so we've got to be prepared for a period of not so much total disruption which is what we've had but a period of random little disruptions that are in some ways even more disruptive than the big one so these are the tactics that we can use to start getting prepared for random disruption
