in this video I wanted to look at a core aspect of context for any organization which is its visioning its vision now if you're familiar with business motivation model this is you'll notice in a moment that this is quite significantly different what business motivation model calls her vision is actually what we would call a goal it's about how the organization of the organization's view of itself what we've got here is that there is a vision a story that holds the whole enterprise together the organization positions itself in relationship to that overall story the vision for the enterprise it then has a decisions about how it's going to play that role it has its own goals in relation to how it does its mission it looks at the outcomes to assess them to assess the goals to assess how well it's doing in its mission and it has tasks that it's then assessing their outcomes so we're going to be looking at the visioning part they're much larger scope of this now behind this is a concept of the enterprise now we've got a fundamental difference going on here between the organization and the other shared enterprise the enterprise is in essence a story and that's what the visioning or the vision is the organization places itself into the market it has a role within the market so it has a role it has its own choices its own mission about how it's going to play that role it has its own goals in relation to how it's going to play that role so vision role mission goal so to understand mission to understand vision we need to understand what the enterprise is what the story is that holds everyone together the thing that links everyone together within this overall story so we come down to a kind of three part phrase in fact a vision statement you see vision statements that can be half a page long a vision statement that really works is really only about three words it should never be longer than about five to ten words at most what we have is we always have a focus or concern everyone is concerned everyone the whole story is concerned about something now the example I'll use here is the Ted videos that the company Technology Entertainment Design that it's they talk about ideas worth spreading so the focus is ideas what is everyone doing about those ideas well one everyone is doing it that Enterprise is spreading ideas and the driver is about well why is this important well the as far as Ted is concerned these are ideas that are worth spreading so if we take that into the the Ted statement its ideas worth spreading and everyone in the whole story is concerned with ideas that are worth now what that tells you from there is that the organization's must be dealing with something to do with that it must have a role an in Ted's case it's about conferences videos and more books for example other people play other roles for example there are the people who do the TED talks they have a different role within that overall story the people who create the ideas the people who are implement those ideas all have different roles within that story but everyone is concerned with the one story of ideas worth spreading it also tells us what the values are so that if we look at that the role is about spreading ideas but the values that drive this relate to worth this gives us our values it also gives us our success criteria one of the values aren't worth well how do we assess what is an idea that is worth spreading we're going to assess things like before during and after how do we assess what is an idea that's worth spreading how do we assess the value of the actual presentation of that idea and later on outside the scope of the organization itself because that's only doing conferences videos and books someone's going to assess whether that idea was worth spreading how was it used how was it applied how did it make sense how could we use it how can we learn from what was done before so all of this arises from that three word statement ideas worth spreading everything that we do within the organization is then tested by not just ourselves that's our mission and our goal but about how everyone in that enterprise sees how we are doing our goal so visioning is really crucially important to make sense of how our organization relates with the enterprise and we can build it out of just three words what is our focus what is the action that where everyone is doing what is the driver that makes it worthwhile the action tells us what our role will be or gives us a range for what our role can be the driver tells us what the values are and success criteria that the enterprise expects from us and to which every promise that we make must align so that's visioning it's really central to making sense of the context for any given organization thanks for watching do look at the YouTube description for links to further detail and don't forget to subscribe for other videos and also to support us on patreon to help us produce these videos and the tools themselves
