for the last part of this brief series on digital transformation I'd like to propose a a simple story based checklist for any kind of transformation it's real this tackles the big picture the story on which any transformation is built we really must not miss miss out this step because a lot of people do and it's often the cause of failure so we really need to do this step so for the checklist itself the first step is about why we map out the story space what is the story itself what are the values that make it all up what are the value flows in an broadest possible sense what is it the people want to exchange to make this story work that'll tell us the key players in the overall story only some of whom will be connecting within our own business story and also the drivers that make it all work to which we need to align our own business the next checklist item is a kind of who who are the players in our part of the story we look at this from the inside in looking at our own internal workings both human and technology-based we're looking at the transaction space about looking at how who are our suppliers our partners our customers in this new way of working how would it make it easier all-round for everyone involved in this space we're looking at the interaction space the direct interactions particularly around things like regulations which if we're doing a transformation we will almost certainly be touching a slightly different set of regulations what are the recruitment issues what are the training issues these are all coming out of that market space who are our competitors who were our collaborators who are our business partners on a business by a business relationship and also looking at the broader story space the expectations that others who we don't necessarily interact with but can influence us who are they also what are the responsibilities for each of these players one of the responsibilities how do we relate with them in terms of responsibilities a third one is about how how we're going to make this work what are the services in the story if we a service approach is generally best for this kind of transformation we describe interactions as services and service cycles what is needed to bring people in to build a relationship to define a contract to do the work and then close up all of those relationships the next one is the what the detail for the story we're talking about the service content the assets the events the resources the capabilities the locations all those kind of things that we need in order to make this work this is where we start going into the detailer setting up the next cycle in the development stage for this digital transformation and finally but an item about outcomes how are we going to review and learn how are we going to make it better what metrics do we need what records do we need working backwards how are we going to get those metrics and records and also always an emphasis on how to do better which will connect us back to the values from those first two steps so WIC aim is to continually learn from each action and continually improve in relation to the story what do we need to make that happen so that's a very simple checklist that you can use there's like a story that talks about the structure of a story that tells you going from the values down to the real practical other gun that continuing on to make it work or in practice
