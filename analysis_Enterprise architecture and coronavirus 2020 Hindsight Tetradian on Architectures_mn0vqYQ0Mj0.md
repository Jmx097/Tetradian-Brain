# Analysis: Enterprise architecture and coronavirus: 2020 Hindsight: Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video emphasizes using **20/20 hindsight** to extract lessons on resilience and business continuity from the coronavirus crisis through a structured after-action review process. It advocates applying an **enterprise architecture lens** to systematically capture data, analyze discrepancies, and improve future responses at individual and team levels. This approach ensures organizations learn effectively from the pandemic without blame, turning disaster into actionable systemic insights.[5][4]

## Key Takeaways
- **Capture data proactively**: Every action must include planning to collect information, insights, and data for later comparison and learning, as lost opportunities cannot be recovered.[5]
- **Two absolute rules for reviews**: Pin stripes at the door (everyone equal, no hierarchy) and no blame (prevents cover-your-backside behavior and enables true learning).[5]
- **Five-part after-action review**: (1) What was supposed to happen (requires a plan); (2) What actually happened (needs captured data); (3) Sources of differences (e.g., failures and surprises like Zoom preference over in-person meetings); (4) Personal lessons (what can I do differently); (5) Team lessons (what can we do differently).[5]
- **Enterprise architecture value**: Viewing the crisis through an EA lens provides a systemic way to analyze the entire "mess" and derive the best learnings for resilience.[5]
- **Broader context**: Ties into EA critiques of IT-centrism, urging focus on whole-enterprise effectiveness amid change, as seen in related Tetradian discussions.[1]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
The video provides a **modified US Army after-action review (AAR)** as a step-by-step process for learning from crises like coronavirus:
1. **Establish rules**: Enforce "pin your stripes at the door" (all equal) and "no blame" to foster open learning.[5]
2. **What was supposed to happen**: Review the original plan for scope clarity and expectations.[5]
3. **What actually happened**: Compare against captured real-time data and insights.[5]
4. **Source of differences**: Identify gaps, failures, and surprises (e.g., unexpected successes like reduced in-person meetings post-Zoom).[5]
5. **Personal improvements**: Ask "What can I do differently next time? What did I miss?"[5]
6. **Team improvements**: Ask "What can we do differently as a team?"[5]
This process requires upfront planning for data collection and applies to enterprise-wide resilience reviews.[5]

## Quotes
- "20/20 hindsight will probably call it looking back trying to make get the lessons learned about resilience about business continuity and all a lot more of that we've got to do to get the best the best opportunity out of this mess that we're currently in."[5]
- "Pin your stripes at the door everyone had a job to do everyone is responsible for their part no one is more important than any other... the other even more important rule no blame the moment there is blame no one is going to learn anything."[5]
- "Looking with hindsight 20/20 looking at this disastrous year with systemic way it will give us the best learnings that's one things that we can learn from looking at enterprise architecture looking with enterprise architecture lens for the whole coronavirus mess."[5]
