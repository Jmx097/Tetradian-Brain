# Analysis: Mythquakes and enterprise architecture: Episode 94, Tetradian on Architectures

## Executive Summary
The video introduces "mythquakes" as collisions between unexamined assumptions (myths) and reality, analogous to earthquakes, with a proposed **Myth Quake (MQ) scale** measuring impact on people from individual to extinction-level events. It applies this concept to **enterprise architecture** by advocating identification, preparation, mitigation, adaptation, recovery, and real-time response to manage risks and opportunities from such disruptions. Examples include supply-chain breakdowns and social issues like gender or race, emphasizing that ignoring myths amplifies impacts.

## Key Takeaways
- **Mythquakes** occur when untested assumptions collide with reality, building tension like earthquakes and releasing in explosive, life-changing ways—positive (e.g., marriage, birth) or challenging (e.g., politics, global events).[3]
- The **MQ scale** assesses impact logarithmically (powers of 10 people affected), from 10^0 (one person) to 10^9.7 (extinction-level), distinct from energy measures like Richter.[3]
- Ignoring myths escalates risks, as seen in just-in-time logistics failures amid global disruptions, affecting millions and tying into enterprise risks like supply-chain breakdowns.[3]
- Enterprise architecture benefits include assessing **mythquake risk/opportunity**, predictability of elements, preparation via small-scale practice, and focusing on constructive change post-event.[3][1]
- Response strategies encompass **mitigation, adaptation** (when risk can't be reduced), **recovery** (resolving disruptions), and real-time actions like triage, escrow, and guidance principles (e.g., actions benefiting everyone).[3]

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials
- **Identify myths**: Scan for unexamined assumptions in architecture domains (business strategy, processes, data, applications, technology); assess predictability and exacerbation risks from denial.[3][1]
- **Prepare and practice**: Build readiness through small disruptions (e.g., adapting to 14-day quarantine); scale methods to larger events for risk mitigation.[3]
- **Mitigate and adapt**: When risks can't be eliminated, adapt by changing four key elements (unspecified in transcript); prioritize opportunities for constructive change.[3]
- **Recovery focus**: Post-mythquake, resolve disruptions by emphasizing positives; develop mythquake response plans including triage (urgent sequencing), escrow (safeguards), and principles like "how does this help everyone."[3]
- **Enterprise integration**: Align with EA best practices—start with business strategy, model future state first, implement governance, and measure progress to handle mythquake-like shifts in IT/business alignment.[1]

## Quotes
- "A myth quake is going to occur whenever an unexamined untested or unverified assumption collides with reality Department often in some major way."[3]
- "We need to look at myth quick risk and opportunity we need to identify what those are because even with each one of those from an architecture perspective there will be elements of that that are relatively predictable."[3]
- "A very real example which we're dealing with right now is about all the myths about just-in-time logistics and globalized supply chains."[3]
- "How does this action help everyone rather than only help me."[3]
