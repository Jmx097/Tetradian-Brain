follow got from the previous episode where we talked about enterprise architecture for every time scale we also want to look at enterprise architecture and how we do it over every possible scope and scale now that sounds perhaps a bit crazy that everything across everywhere well that's about the only way we'll stay sane if we're dealing with something that's a very large scope or very large scale we want to have consistency we want to have the same methods or the same approaches used essentially everywhere this supports fractality thus the self self-similar the the similar things being context independent but we then add to the context to it as we go along so we want some of our tools to be context neutral so that they can help us find what the context actually is and we want some other of our tools to be context specific so that they can help us find the content that we need to make it work in the real world so what we're looking for and what we did with tools like five elements like this one here five elements is a structure that allows us to work exactly the same way and every scope and scale by plugging in other tools as we go down towards the detail but the basic pattern remains the same everywhere so what we're looking for as we've got in five elements is recursive patterns that should work at every scale and we can test that that use those two tests at the extremes to make sure that we've got in the middle roughly right so we've got really small pro scale enterprise architecture that works with does it work right down the same principles work right down at the microsecond the sub microsecond the nanosecond down at the level of individual chips inside in individual processes inside individual chips we also want to be able to scale all the way up to the really big picture enterprise architecture up to the level of a planet or beyond because one things that this shows us is that the same principles that were using for enterprise architecture for an organization can also help us look at what's happening at a global scale that highlights issues such as well to be blunt there's no way to make a possession based economy sustainable there is no way to have infinite growth on a finite planet these are constraints as we looked at in one of the previous episodes so we've got the same tools being used or the same methods being used at every scope and scale this helps us translate cleanly across different contexts and connect things together so that things work together better and on purpose across the whole
