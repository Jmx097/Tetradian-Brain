in my experience one of the hardest things to maintain as an architect is a sense of confidence I'm surrounded all the time by specialists who by definition know more about their own field that I do and when as happened to me today one of them decided aggressively to describe me as a charlatan for not knowing everything about the field or seeing the field in a different way than he did it's very difficult to keep going I remember an interview I went for an actual jet an actual job so called you know permanent role as an enterprise architect and I think the second comment by the CEO there was you've worked in so many different fields that must mean you no good at anything so yeah it's hard to keep going the thing that we do know as architects our specialism is how things connect together at multiple scales and over long periods of time it's very difficult to get this point over and I've discovered the hard way that I think very differently from the way that most people do and the way that I see things is not easy for others to necessarily get it's been a ten-year struggle to get some of the material down in that you change mapping book down into a form that really is much more accepted accessible and acceptable to people that come from a mainstream very business or interview where things are step by step whereas I work very much more fractally connecting things in all sorts of different directions the analogy I use increasingly now is that where everyone else is concerned with the building blocks that hold that our makeup the individual elements of a solution or an either an enterprise what I focus on is the mortar that holds them together because as things move without that mortar without that material that takes up the load and allows us to move things in and out without that what you've got is something that's very well suited has a very good fit for a single purpose but when the world changes around it everything falls apart so that's why an architect is so important but we don't seem to do anything as far as most people are concerned they're working with their individual fiefdom their individual especially in specialities and we connect always between so there's a constant challenge to maintain the confidence that what we do actually is useful what often where our work is most work is only visible when we fail our work is whenever the more was successful we are the less visible our work becomes it's true of a lot of trades such as particularly things like logistics and so on so yes confidence is a major issue that I'm dealing with and one of the themes there is that as Athena talked about the difference between competence non competence and incompetence confidence is when I really know what I'm doing non competence is when I know that I don't know what I'm doing and don't pretend to incompetence is what I pretend to know what I'm doing and don't now I treasure my non competence the trouble is that people always think therefore that I'm not competent to do anything but my job is to learn the basics of something very quickly so I can connect it to something else so these are all very real issues that we face as a practical concern um it's very easy to get knocked down I've lost most of a day from reeling from a very nasty attack so be aware that confidence being certain of what we do being clear that we were not competent in when we are those are very important things to focus on to help us maintain the confidence in what we do
