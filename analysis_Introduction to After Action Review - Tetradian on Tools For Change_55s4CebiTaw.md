# Analysis: Introduction to After Action Review - Tetradian on Tools For Change

## Executive Summary

This video introduces After Action Reviews (AARs) as a structured methodology for continuous improvement rooted in military practice. The speaker emphasizes that AARs operate on a principle of **no blame** and focus on comparing intended outcomes with actual results to extract lessons for future performance improvements.

## Key Takeaways

- **No Blame Culture**: The fundamental rule is that blame prevents learning; participants must "pin their stripes at the door" to ensure individual responsibility without hierarchical judgment
- **Core Comparison Process**: AARs begin by establishing what was meant to happen (the plan), then comparing it to what actually happened (the action)
- **Multi-Level Learning**: The process operates at both individual and team levels, examining what each person and the collective can learn and improve
- **Origin and Evolution**: AARs originated in the military for real-time continuous improvement and have since expanded to emergency services, construction, oil and gas, and business sectors
- **Universal Applicability**: AARs are positioned as useful tools for evaluating any type of action, not limited to specific industries
- **Action-Oriented Outcome**: The process concludes with specific commitments about what individuals and teams will do differently next time

## Actionable Insights / Tutorials

The video outlines a six-step AAR process:

1. **Establish the Plan**: "What was meant to happen?" – Define the intended outcome
2. **Describe the Action**: "What actually happened?" – State facts without commentary or judgment
3. **Identify Differences**: Note gaps between plan and action, including both positive and negative variances
4. **Analyze Root Causes**: Determine the sources and reasons for differences—these are the learning opportunities
5. **Individual Learning**: "What can I learn to do differently next time?" – Connect lessons back to purpose and core principles for each team member
6. **Team Learning**: "How can we improve our coordination?" – Develop collective commitments for improved teamwork and performance
